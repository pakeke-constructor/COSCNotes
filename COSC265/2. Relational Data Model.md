# 2. Relational Data Model

## Formal Definitions

| Formal      | Informal        |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Relation    | Table           |
| Tuple       | Row             |
| Attribute   | Column          |
| Degree      | Num. attributes |
| Cardinality | Num. rows       |

- Relation: set of tuples
- Schema of relation: $R(A_1, ..., A_n)$
- Tuple: **ordered** set of values
- Domain: set of valid values for an attribute

Relation: subset of the cartesian product of the domains i.e. any valid combination of values for all the attributes of the table. $R$ is the **intension** - the schema of the relation, and $r\ of\ R$ is an **extension** - a specific valid value of the relation.

The ordering of tuples irrelevant, but the ordering of values within a tuple relevant.

### Constraints

Conditions that hold for all valid relation instances.

#### Domain constraint

Specifies that all values in a relation must be inside their respective domains.

#### Key Constraint

- **Superkey** of $R$: set of attributes such that no two tuples will have the same value
- **Key** - a **minimal superkey**: removing any attribute stops it from being a superkey
- A **primary key** is arbitrarily chosen from the set of **candidate keys**. The rest are called **secondary keys**
  - Attributes of the candidate keys are called **prime attributes**

#### Entity Integrity Constraint

Primary key values must not be null.

#### Referential Integrity Constraint

**Referencing relation** has foreign key attribute referencing the primary key of the **referenced relation**. The value can be null, and the primary key can itself be a foreign key.

#### Semantic Integrity Constraint

Constraints not expressed by the model and relating to the application semantics.

## EER to Relation Mapping Algorithm

1. Simple tables: make a new table, pick any key as the primary key
2. Weak entity; make a new table, with the primary key being the combination of the owner and partial key. If the partial key is composite, use the components
3. 1:N: Put the foreign key in the 'N' side
4. 1:1: Put the foreign key on the side with total participation
5. M:N: make a new table with two foreign keys; the combination of the two form the primary key
6. Multivalued attributes: make a new table with a foreign key to the owner. The combination of the value of the attribute and foreign key is the primary key
7. N-ary relationships: make a new table, with the combination of the foreign keys being the primary key.
8. Specialization/generalization:
   - Superclass has its own table with general attributes; subclasses have their own table with specific attributes; the primary key is a foreign key to superclass
   - Total specialization: tables just for the subclasses (duplicating superclass attributes)
   - Disjoint specialization: single table with attributes for every subclass, plus attribute denoting which subclass it is (called the **type**)
   - Overlapping specializations: same as above, but Boolean for every subclass indicating which subclasses it is a member of
9. Categories: primary key is an artificial, automatically generated ID; all superclasses of the category have this as a foreign key

## Relational Algebra

### Variables

$$
VARNAME \leftarrow operation
$$

### Select

- $\sigma_{condition}(relation)$
- Horizontal slices of a table
- Condition can be composite; use logical operators

### Project

- $\pi_{attribute\_list}(relation)$
- Vertical slices of a table
- Returns a set, so if two rows are identical the duplicate will not be added

### Rename

- $\rho_{S(col1, ... coln)}(R)$
- Renames relation properties

### Set

Union-compatible relations: require the **same degree** and pairs of corresponding attributes to have the **same domain**.

- Union: $S \cup R$
- Intersection: $S \cap R$
- Difference: $S - R$
- Cartesian Product: $S \times R$

Union and intersection are:

- Commutative: order of arguments doesn't matter
- Associative: order of operations doesn't matter

#### Joins

$$
R \Join_{condition} S
$$

Equijoin:

- $condition \leftarrow R.col = S.col$
- $R.col$ and $S.col$ are both present

Natural join:

- $R * S$
- Special case of equijoin where primary and foreign keys have the same name
- The primary and foreign key columns are merged

$\theta$ join:

- $condition \leftarrow R.col\ OP\ S.col$ where  $OP\in\{<, <=, >=, >, !=\}$

The same type of joins are available for left, right and full outer joins (symbols have two horizontal lines sticking out of the top and bottom of the left/right end of the $\Join$ symbol).

### Division

'For every' queries.

If $R(X)$ and $S(Z)$, $R \div S = T(Y)$ where $Y = X - Z$; columns only in $S$ will not appear.

For a tuple $t$ to appear in $T$, the values in $t$ must appear in $R$ in combination with **every** tuple in $S$.

If $S$ contains a single key $A$ and $R$ contains an additional column $B$, then $T$ will be a table with a single column $B$. If a value $b$ exists in $B$, there exists a tuple $(a, b)$ for all values of $a$ found in $S$.

e.g. if $S = {(a1), (a2)}$ and $R={(a1, b1), (a2, b1), (a1, b2)}$ then $T$ will contain ${(a1)}$.
If $S$ is a table and $R$ is a table with the exact same columns plus a primary key:

- For the id to appear, the id must appear along with every tuple in $S$
- The resultant table will only have the primary key (columns in $R$ minus columns in $S$)

Equivalent to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
T1 &\leftarrow \pi_Y(R) \text{ (getting rid of columns only in S)} \\
T2 &\leftarrow \pi_Y((S \times T1) - R) \\
T1 &\leftarrow T1 - T2
\end{aligned}
$$

If $R \times S = T$, then $T \div S = R$.

[Explanation of division](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~mccann/research/divpresentation.pdf):

$$
\delta = \pi_{A-B}(\alpha) \\
\alpha \div \beta = \delta - \pi_{A-B}((\delta \times \beta) - \alpha)
$$

- $\delta$ is a superset of the desired result; some need to be removed
- $\delta \times \beta$ gives all possible tuples that could be contained in a relation with schema $A$
- $(\delta \times \beta) - \alpha$ gives all possible tuples not in $\alpha$
- This can be subtracted from $\delta$ after a project operation

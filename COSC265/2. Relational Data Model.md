# Relational Data Model

## Formal Definitions

| Formal      | Informal        |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Relation    | Table           |
| Tuple       | Row             |
| Attribute   | Column          |
| Degree      | Num. attributes |
| Cardinality | Num. rows       |

- Relation: set of tuples
- Schema of relation: `R(A_1, ..., A_n)`
- Tuple: **ordered** set of values
- Domain: set of valid values for an attribute

Relation: subset of the cartesian product of the domains i.e. any valid combination of values for all the attributes of the table. `R` is the **intension** - the schema of the relation, and `r of R` is an **extension** - a specific valid value of the relation.

The ordering of tuples irrelevant, but the ordering of values within a tuple relevant

### Constraints

Conditions that hold for all valid relation instances.

#### Domain constraint

Specifies that all values in a relation must be inside their respective domains

#### Key Constraint

- **Superkey** of `R`: set of attributes such that no two tuples will have the same value
- **Key** - a **minimal superkey**: removing any attribute stops it from being a superkey
- A **primary key** is chosen from the **candidate keys**. The rest are called **secondary keys**
  - Attributes of the candidate keys are called **prime attributes**

#### Referential Integrity Constraint

**Referencing relation** has foreign key attribute referencing the primary key(s) of the **referenced relation**. The value can be null, and the primary key can itself be a foreign key.

#### Semantic Integrity Constraint

Constraints not expressed by the model and relating to the application semantics.

## EER to Relation Mapping Algorithm

- Simple tables: make a new table, pick any key as the primary key
- Weak entity; make a new table, with the primary key being the combination of the owner and partial key. If the partial key is composite, use the components
- 1:N: Put the foreign key in the 'N' side
- 1:1: Put the foreign key on the side with total participation
- M:N: make a new table with two foreign keys; the combination of the two form the primary key
- Multivalued attributes: make a new table with a foreign key to the owner. The combination of the value of the attribute and foreign key is the primary key
- N-ary relationships: make a new table, with the combination of the foreign keys being the primary key.
- Specialization/generalization:
  - Superclass has its own table with general attributes; subclasses have their own table with specific attributes; the primary key is a foreign key to superclass
  - Total specialization: tables just for the subclasses (duplicating superclass attributes)
  - Disjoint specialization: single table with attributes for every subclass, plus attribute denoting which subclass it is
  - Overlapping specializations: same as above, but Boolean for every subclass indicating which subclasses it is a member of
- Categories: primary key is an artificial, automatically generated id; all superclasses of the category have this as a foreign key

## Relational Algebra

### Variables

`VARNAME <- operation`

### Select

- `\sigma_{condition}(relation)`
- Horizontal slices of a table
- Condition can be composite; use logical operators

### Project

- `\pi_{attribute\_list}(relation)`
- Vertical slices of a table
- Returns a set, so if two rows are identical the duplicate will not be added

### Rename

- `\rho_{S(col1, ... coln)}(R)`
- Renames relation properties

### Set

Require the same degree and corresponding attributes to have the same domain

- Union: `S \cup R`
- Intersection: `S \cap R`
- Difference: `S - R`
- Cartesian Product: `S \times R`

Union and intersection are:

- Commutative: order of arguments doesn't matter
- Associative: order of operations doesn't matter

#### Joins

`R \bowtie_{condition} S`

Equijoin:

- `condition <- R.col = S.col`
- `R.col` and `S.col` are both present

Natural join:

- `condition <- R * S`
- Special case of equijoin where primary and foreign keys have the same name
- The primary and foreign key columns are merged

`\theta` join:

- `condition <- R.col OP S.col` where the operator is in `{<. <=, >=, >, !=}`

The same type of joins are available for `\leftouterjoin`, `\rightouterjoin` and `\fullouterjoin`

### Division

'For every' queries

If `R(X)` and `S(Z)`, `R \div S = T(Y)` where `Y = X âˆ’ Z`; columns only in `S` will not appear

For a tuple `t` to appear in `T`, the values in `t` must appear in `R` in combination with **every** tuple in `S`

If `S` contains a single key `A` and `R` contains an additional column `B`, then `T` will be a table with a single column `B`. If a value `b` exists in `B`, there exists a tuple `(a, b)` for all values of `a` found in `S`.


e.g. if `S = {(a1), (a2)}` and `R={(a1, b1), (a2, b1), (a1, b2)}` then `T` will contain `{(a1)}`
If `S` is a table and `R` is a table with the exact same columns plus a primary key:

- For the id to appear, the id must appear along with every tuple in S
- The resultant table will only have the primary key (columns in R minus columns in S)

Equivalent to:

`T1 <- \pi_Y(R)` (getting rid of columns only in `S`)

`T2 <- \pi_Y((S \times T1) - R)`

`T1 <- T1 - T2`

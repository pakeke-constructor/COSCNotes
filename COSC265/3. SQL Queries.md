## Oracle SQL Data Definition

SQL relations (tables) is a *multi-set*, NOT a *set* of tuples. Using `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE`, or the `DISTINCT` option in a query, constraints the result to a set. `DISTINCT` requires search to ensure duplicate tuples are not returned, so is slower than using `ALL` (the default)

Naming:

- Databases up to 8 characters
- Other names up to 30 characters
- Table names cannot begin with `sys_`
- Case insensitive

### Expression

An attribute (i.e. column name) or combination of attributes, operators and functions

### Binary Operators

- Comparisons: `<` `<=`, `=`, `!=`/`<>`, `>=` and `>`
- Logical: `NOT`, `AND` and `OR`, in that order of priority. Use parentheses if needed
- `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` can be used for numeric values
- String concatenation: `||`

### Functions

Scalar:

- Type conversion: `TO_CHAR`, `TO_DATE`, `TO_NUMBER` etc.
- Numeric: `ABS`, `CEIL`, `FLOOR`, `EXP`, `LOG`, `MOD`, `POWER`, `ROUND`, SQRT` etc.
- String: `SUBSTRING`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`, `TRANSLATE`, `CONVERT`, `LENGTH`, `LPAD` etc.
- Date/time: `SYSDATE`, `ADD_MONTHS`, `MONTHS_BETWEEN`, `NEXT_DAY` etc.

Aggregate/Set:

- `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG` etc.

### Predicates

- `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`, `EXISTS`, `IS NULL`

### Misc.

SQL+:

- `set autocommit on`
- `describe schema.tablename`
- `set linesize n`
- `@sql-script-path`

### Create Schema

Schemas are used to group tables together. Permissions are set on a per-schema level.

```
CREATE SCHEMA schema-name
AUTHORIZATION owner
```

### Create Table

```
CREATE TABLE [schema-name.]table-name
(
  column-name column-specification[,
  column-name column-specification]*

  [constraint-name constraint-specification]*
)
```

Use `CREATE TABLE table-name AS (query)` to populate the table with data.


#### Notes

Constraints can be inline or defined after the columns. If the latter, multiple rows can be referenced.

Inline:

`column-definition constraints` where `constraints` can be:

- `NOT NULL`
- `DEFAULT default-value`
- `UNIQUE`
- `REFERENCES table-name` (with the primary key being the foreign key)
- `CONSTRAINT constraint-name constraint-definition` where `constraint-definition` can be:
  - `PRIMARY KEY`
  - `REFERENCES referenced-table[.foreign-key-column]`
  - `CHECK (condition)`
    - e.g. `column-name > 10`, `column-1 != column-2`
    - Value in array: `column-name IN ('val1', 'val2')`
    - The condition can only involve the name of the current column if it is inline


To define a primary key after column definitions: `PRIMARY KEY (column-name)`. A composite primary key can be made by passing multiple arguments.

To define foreign keys after column definitions: `FOREIGN KEY(column-list) REFERENCES foreign-table(column-list)`

```
FOREIGN KEY (column-name)
REFERENCES foreign-table (foreign-table-key)
[ON DELETE integrity-option]
[ON UPDATE integrity-option]
```

To add constraints after defining the tablE:

`ALTER TABLE table-name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint-name constraint-definition`

Where `integrity-option` is one of `RESTRICT`, `CASCADE`, `SET NULL` or `SET DEFAULT`.

Domain: basically `typedef` for SQL. NOT in Oracle:

 - `CREATE DOMAIN domain-name type-definition [CHECK check-statement]`
   - e.g. `check-statement` could be `(VALUE IS NOT NULL)`

### Drop Table

Drops the relation (base table) and definition: `DROP TABLE table-name`

### Alter Table

Add, delete or modify attributes/constraints

Add/modify: `ALTER TABLE table-name ADD|MODIFY column-name column-definition`. The `NOT NULL` constraint is only allowed if it also has a `DEFAULT default-value` constraint. Otherwise, the column must be added without the `NOT NULL` constraint then update all the rows, then alter the definition.

Delete column and all constraints: `ALTER TABLE table-name DROP [COLUMN] column-name RESTRICT|CASCADE`

Delete constraint: `ALTER TABLE table-name DROP [CONSTRAINT] constraint-name RESTRICT|CASCADE`. If the constraint is a primary key or unique, `CASCADE` drops all referencing foreign keys; `RESTRICT` stops the operation if there are any referencing foreign keys.

### Drop Schema

`DROP SCHEMA schema-name RESTRICT|CASCADE`. `RESTRICT` only allows the operation to run if the schema is empty; `CASCADE` drops all children objects as well.

## Oracle SQL Queries

### `SELECT`

```sql
SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] attribute-list
FROM table-list
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY grouping-attributes]
[HAVING group-condition]
[ORDER BY attribute-list]
[OFFSET n]
[FETCH NEXT m ROWS ONLY]
```

Six clauses; the last four are optional

- `SELECT` is like the project, `\pi` operator
  - `ALL` is the default; `DISTINCT` removes duplicate tuples
    - The latter requires comparisons for each tuple so may be slower
  - `attribute-list` is a comma separated list where each item is:
    - `*` for all columns in the table
    - A column name
    - The result of some operation (e.g. column_name * 10)
- `WHERE` is like the select, `\sigma` operator
- `ORDER BY` does sorting

### Table Alias

Oracle uses the syntax, `tableName alias`.

Other SQL implementations use `tableName AS alias`.

This may be useful when referring to two entries in the a single table (e.g. find rows where the last names the same).

The result of a nested select statement can also be aliased: `(SELECT clause that is probably using JOINs) alias`

#### Attribute list

The attribute list can contain column names, aggregate functions and constants

- Except for `COUNT(*)`, aggregate functions ignore `NULL VALUES`
- Can also use `DISTINCT` within aggregate functions: `COUNT(DISTINCT origin)` will return the number of distinct origin values
- Can also be a nested select statement returning a single row and column

#### Some `WHERE` predicates

- Range (inclusive): `column-name BETWEEN min AND max`
  - Can be used for numbers, dates and strings
- Membership: `column-name IN (val_1, ..., val_n)`
- Pattern matching with `LIKE`: `column-name LIKE pattern`
  - Enclose `pattern` in single quotes
  - `%` acts like `.*` in a regular expression
  - `_` acts like `.` in a regular expression
  - Can set custom escape character: `'Pattern\_Using\_Underscore` ESCAPE '\'
- Pattern matching with regular expressions: `REGEXP_LIKE(column-name, pattern, [param])`
  - `param`: `i` (case-insensitive), `c` (case-sensitive), `x` (ignore whitespace), 'm' (multiline)
- `NULL`: `IS [NOT] NULL`; `NULL != NULL` so cannot use equality comparisons

#### `GROUP BY`

For applying aggregate functions to *groups of tuples*; each group is a set of tuples where they have the same value for the grouping attribute(s) (comma-separated list). This is used for summary information, and is often phrased as *for each entity ...*.

e.g. `SELECT origin, COUNT(origin) FROM routes GROUP BY origin` returns number of times each origin value appears.

e.g. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT type), director FROM movie GROUP BY director` returns the number of genres of movies each director has directed.

When using `GROUP BY`, all non-aggregate attributes need to be referenced. This is as the grouping reduces the result into a single tuple, which may not be possible if they are not all referenced. For example, if `(a, b) = (0, 0), (0, 1)` is grouped by `a`, it must either pick one of the values or pick both, neither of which are allowed.

This can happen even if the primary key is used as the grouping attribute.

#### `HAVING`

Retrieves the values of these functions only for groups that satisfy certain conditions - i.e. it filters out groups.

e.g. `SELECT origin, COUNT(origin) FROM routes GROUP BY origin HAVING COUNT(origin) > 10`

`COUNT(*)` gets the count for the group.

#### `ORDER BY`

Sorts tuples based on the values of some attributes:

`ORDER BY [column-name ASC|DESC] [, column-name ASC|DESC]*`

Default is `ASC`. Sorts by the first column name first, and when the values are equal, it sorts by the second column etc. The sort is not stable.

#### Nested Queries

A nested query/sub-query be specified within the WHERE and HAVING clauses of an outer query. The sub-query must be enclosed within parentheses.

- `ORDER BY` is not allowed
- The sub-query `SELECT` list must consist of a single attribute/expression unless the outer query uses `EXISTS`
  - If using the `in` predicate, it should return a table with one column and *n* rows
  - If using a equality predicate, it should return a table with one column and one row
- Attributes from the outer query's table can be referenced in the sub-query; this is called **correlation**, and means that the result of the sub-query is different for each row of the outer query
  - A table alias may need to be used
- A sub-query can appear on both sides of a comparison

Examples:

- `SELECT * FROM customer WHERE num_orders > (SELECT AVG(num_orders) FROM customer)`
- `SELECT * FROM movie WHERE (SELECT id FROM director WHERE lname='Nolan')`
- `SELECT * FROM movie M1 WHERE M1.awards = (SELECT MAX(awards) FROM movie M2 WHERE M1.director = M2.director)` returns the movies that have one the most awards for a given director

##### `EXISTS`

Used to check if result of *correlated* sub-query is empty.

e.g. `SELECT * FROM director D1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM movie WHERE D1.id = director AND type='comedy')` finds directors that have directed at least one comedy.

#### Multi-table queries

Queries used nested queries using the `=` or `IN` conditions **can always be expressed as a single query**. This does a JOIN in the background, and so is much more efficient than correlated nested queries. The FROM clause may contain more than one table.

e.g. `SELECT title FROM movie, director WHERE dnumber=director AND lname='Nolan'`

In general, if you have *n* tables, will need *n-1* join conditions.


If there is no WHERE clause, all tuples of the relations are selected and the result is equivalent to the **Cartesian product**, most of which will be nonsense.

Multi-table query for the same table: `SELECT DISTINCT M1.director FROM movie M1, movie M2 WHERE M1.director = M2.director AND M1.type='comedy' and M2.type='drama'`. A similar result could be done using an `INTERSECT` operation.

#### Specifying Joins in SQL2

`FROM table1 JOIN_TYPE table2 ON col1=col2`

Where the join type is one of:

- `JOIN`
- `NATURAL JOIN`
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- `CROSS JOIN` (Cartesian product)

The result of a join statement can also be used as a table e.g.:

```sql
SELECT title FROM
  (SELECT * FROM movie JOIN director ON movie.director=director.id) movieDirector
WHERE movieDirector.lname='Nolan' /* single quotes only */
```

To select all from both tables, use `SELECT movie.*, director.*`

#### Set operations

`UNION`, `EXCEPT` (`MINUS` in Oracle) and `INTERSECT`. The results are sets - no duplicates, unless the keyword `ALL` is appended.

The two operands - select statements (in brackets), must return a table with the same number of properties and compatible data types.

#### `ANY`/`ALL`

Used with comparison operators and nested queries.

`ANY` equivalent to `IN`. It is sometimes called `SOME`

`NOT ALL` equivalent to `NOT IN`

The following will return movies that got more awards than all movies by a particular director:

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie WHERE awards > ALL (
  SELECT awards FROM movie, director WHERE movie.director = director.id AND lname = 'Nolan'
)
```

#### Division

`R \div S = T(A)`

R, S has at least one common attribute
e.g. The result of division with `R(A, B)` and `S(B, C)` will have `(A, B) - (B, C)` = `(A)`

Directors that have directed at least one movie of each type:

```sql
SELECT fname, lname FROM director WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT * FROM movie M1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM movie M2 WHERE M2.director = director.id AND M2.type = M1.type
  )
)
```

The `M1.type = M2.type` is able to get every single type of movie as it is not constrained to any particular director.

The following also gives the same result:

```sql
SELECT fname, lname FROM DIRECTOR
  JOIN movie ON director.id = movie.director
  GROUP BY director, fname, lname
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT type) = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT type) FROM movie
  )
```

The nested query is not correlated

#### `DUAL` table

In Oracle, it is a dummy table with a single column and row which is used to get scalar values e.g. `SELECT sysdate FROM DUAL`

# 0. Introduction

## Definitions

- Entity: concept/object about which information is stored
- Attribute: property of an entity
- Mini-world: part of the real world about which data is stored
  - A database represents only relevant aspects of the mini-world

## Database Management System (DBMS)

A software system facilitating the creation/maintenance of a database:

- Database software: DBMS + applications
- Database system: database + software

Functionality:

- Database definition
- Loading the database into memory
- Manipulation: queries/inserts/deletions/updates
- Concurrent processing by users/programs
- Security measures to prevent unauthorized access

Disadvantages: complexity, size, cost, performance

Advantages: reduced development time, flexibility, economies of scale

The **schema**, also known as the database *intension*, rarely changes, but the **state** of the database, called the *extension* changes frequently. The actual data stored in the database at a particular moment in time is called the *instance*.

### Three-Schema Architecture

**Internal** schema: deals with the physical level (e.g. path to database), but not the actual physical devices

**Conceptual** schema: describes the structure of the database; entities, attributes relationships etc.

**External** schema: view visible to end users. It may be a subset of the conceptual schema, allowing the user to access only what is relevant to them

### Three-Level Data Model

**Conceptual/high-level/semantic**: concepts close to the way users perceive the data

**Physical/low-level/internal**: concepts describing details of how data is actually stored

**Implementation/representational**: half-way point

### DBMS Languages

**Data Definition/Description Language** (DDL): specifies the schema of the database (e.g. `CREATE`, `ALTER`)

**View Definition Language** (VDL): language used to create user views - mapping from the conceptual to the external schema

**Storage Definition Language** (SDL): language used to specify the internal schema - how the data is actually stored

**Data Manipulation Language** (DML): language used to manipulate the database (e.g. `SELECT`, `INSERT`). They can be high level, non-procedural languages like SQL or low-level procedural languages where records are updated one at a time

# 1. Data Modelling

## Phases of Database Design

- Conceptual design: ER/EER diagrams
- Logical design: conversion into DBMS-specific form (SQL schema)
- Physical design: hardware the data is stored on

## Entity-Relationship

Attributes:

- **Composite** attributes: `Name(Sub, Property)`
  - Decompose into **atomic** attributes
- **Multivalued**: `{ attributeName }`
  - Double eclipse
- **Derived**: dotted eclipse
- **Primary Key**
  - Can be composite
  - **Must be single valued**
  - Underlined

Relationships:

- **Degree**: number of participating entity types
  - **Recursive** relationships are unary
    - Require labels for the roles
- Can have attributes, but **not key attributes**
- Relationship **type**: description of schema, constraints etc.
- Relationship **set**: current set of relationships

Weak Entities:

- Exactly **one partial key**
  - May be composite
  - Unique for a given owner
- Can have **multiple owners** in its identifying relationship

Cardinality Ratio:

- '{A} can be in {B cardinality} relationships with {B}'

Structural Constraints:

- `(min, max)`. `max` can be `n` (or `m`)
- Read the opposite way to cardinality constraints
- Use for n-ary relationships

## Enhanced Entity-Relation

- `Subclass ----\subset ---- Superclass`: optional subclass
- `(Subclass1 ----\subset, Subclass2 ----\subset)----d----Superclass`: partial disjoint specialization
- `(Subclass1 ----\subset, Subclass2 ----\subset)----d====Superclass`: total disjoint specialization
- `(Subclass1 ----\subset, Subclass2 ----\subset)----o----Superclass`: partial overlapping specialization

Two subclasses can merge if they have the same unique identifier - **they share a root superclass**. In this case, the structure that is formed is called a **lattice**.

- `Category====\subset====u----(Class1-----, Class2=====)`: class 1 is partial, class 2 is total

Union: each instance of the category is a member of *one* of the superclasses. The category will have an artificial **surrogate** key.

### Why SENG302

SENG302 about building software as a team. You are the project, not the project itself. SENG302 has a year-long project compared to other courses which have theory then a few weeks of project work, forcing sustainability that can be ignored in shorter projects. Any poor decisions made early-on will haunt the team for months; living with the consequences of your decisions.

<!--

Software projects fail because of:

- Project management: poor planning, insufficient communication, lack of alignment and involvement with stakeholders

### TODO heading

Confidence:

- Having both humility and assurance in your self worth

- Taking the initiative
- Split large tasks into subtasks

Time Management:

- For each week, allocate time for SENG302 in terms of t-shirt sizes

Sprint 1 has 20 medium-sized teams split into front/back end teams (back-end green, front-end blue); sprint 2 combines teams. Sprints are approximately 3 weeks long.

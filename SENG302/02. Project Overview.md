# 02. Project Overview

Problem: lots of waste, food and otherwise

- Large amounts of food wasted: expires, rots etc.
0 US: ~40% of food uneaten
- NZ: ~160,000 tonnes/year

Dates on food:

- Sell by: government regulation or something similar
- Best before: recommended to consume before the dates
- Use by/expiry: strongly discourage consuming after the date

Vitamins, cleaning products etc. degrade over time. End-of-season items sent to the dump

## Project: *Wasteless*

Reducing waste, prices, pollution

- A responsive web application
- Accounts for individuals/businesses
- Users can sell/advertise products getting close to expiry at reduced prices
  - At least initially, both individuals/businesses can buy/sell
- Products:
  - Dates (sell by/best before/use by)
  - Quantity
  - Price
  - Images

Functionality:

- CRUD
  - Update is important
  - Not everything needs to be deleted
- Search
- Location
  - My location
  - Maps/directions
- Social-media style
  - Profile (account info, image, location, currency)
  - Follow/unfollow accounts; appear in home page (timeline?)
  - 'Interested in' (like products etc.) should appear in home page
  - DM
- Information (recycling info etc.)

Backlog will be linked on Learn.

## Architecture

Architecture is a **set of decisions**.

It is a **record** of what decisions were made and **why**.

### Stack

- Front end: Vue.js
- Communication: RESTful API
- Backend: Sprint
- Database: MariaDB

API has been defined by Matthew; this must be followed to the letter.

## Quality

Software **satisfying the stated and implied needs**; the degree to which it meets **requirements and customer needs/expectations**.

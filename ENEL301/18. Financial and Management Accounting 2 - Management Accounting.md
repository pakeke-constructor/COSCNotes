## Cost Concepts

A technique for determining the cost of a project.

### Manufacturing Costs

Raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. Inventory size determined by:

- Demand
- Lead time and production process
- Nature of goods
- Supply chain management (e.g. JiT)

### Fixed Costs

Costs that do not vary with output e.g. rent, depreciation, lighting and supervisor salaries.

Usually they are only fixed over a certain range of production - the *relevant range*. Factors such as requiring bigger warehouses limit the range.

### Variable Costs

Cost that vary with output:

- Direct materials
- Direct labour

Usually a linear function of quantity.

### Total Cost

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{TC}(x) &= \mathrm{VC}(x) + \mathrm{FC} \\
               &\approx mx + c
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $x$ is quantity.

Total costs can be calcualted through several methods:

- Job costing (for one-off jobs)
  - Sum cost of raw materials materials, labour, overhead, etc.
- Process costing (for mass production lines)
  - Sum costs of individual processes per batch
  - Does not include cost of raw materials, overhead, shipping etc.
- Standard costing (for large manufacturers producing different products but with some sort of standard costing)
  - Cost per unit output established in advance of production/service delivery
  - Establish standards of work (e.g. worker can pack x products/minute) then calculate time and hence cost to pack some unit of product (e.g. container)
The above are all CPV methods - cost-volume-profit. Activity based costing, which tracks hidden overhead costs to the activties that cause them, is not covered.

- Prime costs: AKA direct costs
- Fixed/misc: electricity, rent etc.
- Indirect material: cleaning supplies, glues etc. that aren't allocated on a per-unit basis
- Selling price (SP): price each unit is sold at
- Total revenue (TR): selling price times units sold
  - Not all units produced may be sold
- Profit (P): revenue after deducting relevant costs

### Price-Demand Relationship

Law of Demand: inverse price-quantity relationship (price rising reduces quantity demanded). Not necessarily linear.

$$
\text{SP} = a - b\text{D}
$$

Where $\text{D}$ is the demand (units demanded) and $\text{SP}$ is the selling price.

Hence, total revenue, $\text{TR} = \text{SP} \cdot \text{D} = a\text{D} - b\text{D}^2$  where $a$ and $b$ are positive and $D < \frac{a}{b}$.

### Limitations of CPV Analysis

CPV analysis has a short-term decision-making model with no recognition of the time value of money.

It:

- Assumes clear separation of fixed and variable costs
- Assumes constant unit (variable) cost and revenue - not true in reality

Long-term analysis should consider the entire life-cycle of the product (activity-based costing). In the future the selling price may include externalities such as the cost of battery recycling for EVs, carbon costs for flight tickets etc.

### Break-Even Analysis

Used to evaluate the minimum amount of sales required to cover costs at a given price.

At break even, $\text{TR} = \text{TC}. Hence:

$$
\text{SP} \cdot x = \text{VC}(x) + \text{FC}
$$

Where $x$ is the number of units.

This assumes that any quantity can be sold at a given price and that the total cost curve is a straight line.

Significance:

- If production/sales (assuming they are equal) is less than the break-even cost, a loss will occur
- Lower break-even quantities are generally desireable. This can be done by:
  - Reducing the fixed costs
  - Reducing variable costs
  - Increasing the revenue rate (essentially the selling price)

### Average Cost and Economies of Scale

Average Cost (AC): total cost over units produced. This is the basis for *normal pricing*.

As production volume increases, average costs decreases - fixed costs spread over a larger number of units.

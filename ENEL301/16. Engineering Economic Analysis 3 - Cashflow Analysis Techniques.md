# 16. Engineering Economic Analysis 3 - Cashflow Analysis Techniques

> Risk expects appropriate return

How do we use these fundamentals as a basis for engineering economic analysis?

How do we ensure we make decisions that are economically justified?

By comparing **cash flows** of alternatives.

## Systematic Economic Analaysis Technique (SEAT)

1. Identify the investment alternatives (doing nothing may be a valid option)
2. Define the planning horizon
3. Specify the discount rate
4. Estimate the cash flows
5. Compare the alternatives
6. Perform supplementary analyses (e.g. break-even, risk, sensitivity to discount rate)
7. Select the preferred alternative

### 3. Specify the Discount Rate

Example: 2019 Exam

\$1.1 million dollars in capital required. 200K sitting in a bank account at 2% interrest per annum (personal opportunity cost), 500K from the bank at 4% interest (debt cost), 400K from rich aunt in return for 50% ownership, expecting an average rate of return of at least 25% (equity cost).

a. What fundamental principle of economic analysis is behind aunt's rate of return? What assumption is she making? ~~Discount rate?~~ risk expects appropriate return

b. Weighted cost of capital

~~1.02 * 200/1100 - 1.04 * 500/1100 - 1.25 * 400/1100 = -0.74~~

$$
-\mathrm{WCC} = \frac{200 \cdot 2% + 500 \cdot 4% + 400 \cdot 25%}{1100} = 11.27%
$$

### 4. Estimate the Cash Flows

Engineering economic decisions usually involve:

- Lump sum payments/costs
  - At the beginning of the project (initial cost)
  - At the end of the project (sold, salvage or remediation)
- Streams of cash benefits as a result of the investment over future years (operating revenues)
- Ongoing regular outgoings (operating/maintenance costs) 

Cash Flows:

- Be consistent with inflation
  - A cash flow can be in real or nominal dollars
  - If the cash flow is real, the discount rate must be real
- Cash flow is after tax
- When considering cash flows, focus on the difference between alternatives, not the absolute value
- Consider all relevant criteria
- Be clear regarding uncertainty: how risk is treated (be consistent in use of best/worst/most likely scenarios)
- Cash flow != accounting profit

Sunk costs: disregard money already spent as a result of past decisions.

### 4. Compare the Alternatives

Analyze future cash flows considering: 

- Payback period
- Net present value
- Internal rate of return

#### Method 1: Payback

Time it takes for incremental benefits to pay back the initial investment.

Often used as part of an initial screening process when evaluating investments.

Basic method is to establish is payback period is less than some period of time defined by management policy (could be set completely arbitrarily). If it is within the acceptable range a formal evaluation can be done.

Downsides:

- Simple version does not account for time value of money
- Does not consider cash flows past the payback period
- Biased against long-term projects
- Arbitrary cut-off point

#### Method 2a: Net Present Value

Discounted future value (future cash flows) minus present value (initial cost):

$$
\text{NPV} = \sum_{=0}\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

Where $r$ the discount rate/minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR).

NPV provides an estimate of a **project's net contribution** to the value of the firm by giving proper treatment to the time value of money and the riskiness of the investment.

Steps:

1. Determine the initial cost of the project $C_0$ - $t = 0$ so no discounting is required to get the present value
2. Estimate the project's future cash flows (nominal or real?)
3. Determine the riskiness of the project and hence the discount rate
  - Risk free? Use the risk free rate
  - Risky? Discount rate will be higher
4. Calculate the NPV
5. Choose the option with the highest NPV (or if there is only one option, if it is positive)

Advantages:

- Uses discounted cash flow - considers time value of money
- Is a direct measure of the 'value' of the project to the firm
- Is robust as a comparitive tool

Disadvantages:

- Difficult to understand without accounting/finance background
- Difficult to estimate discount rate

**If payback and NPV contradict each other, always use NPV.**

##### Example: Power Plant

900 million dollar power plant with cash flows of 300 million a year for 4 years, after which it will be decomissioned at a cost of 90 million.

```
 -900   300/r   300/r^2  300/r^3 300/r^4  -90/r^5
---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
t  0      1      2      3      4      5
```

At 6% discount rate, NPV is 72 million.

At 16% discount rate, NPM is -1 million.

#### Example: Solar Panels

\$13,204 system cost with estimated annual savings of \$1,478 (real cost). Assuming a 20 year system life and 7% discount (real) rate (average after tax rate of return for stock market):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NPV} &= C_0 + \mathrm{PV}_\text{annuity} \\
             &= C_0 + C\left[\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1 + r)^t} \right] \\
             &= -\$13,\!204 + \$1,\!478 \cdot 10.59 \\
             &= \$2\!454
\end{aligned}
$$

Leads to

Systems theory of organization:

- Organizations are systems
- Systems are sets of interrelated parts operating as a whole in pursuit of a common goal
- Has four major components: inputs, transformation processes, output, feedback

### The Process of Management

Before getting things done, the following must be established:

- What is the purpose of the organization (vision, mission)
- Why is the organization pursuing the vision?
- How will the organization achieve the vision (strategy)

```
Vision and mission: organization's purpose
                   |
                   | leads to
                   v
Strategy: how the objectives will be achieved
                   |
                   | leads to
                   v
Implementation: resource allocation, operations needed 
                to fulfil the strategy
```

### Challenges

- Productivity
- Efficiency
- Customer sat
- Profitability (or other performance indicators)

But recently also:

- Sustainability
- Equity/diversity
- Continuous change

### Roles of a Manager

POLC:

- Planning: setting performance objectives and deciding how to achieve them
- Organizing: arranging tasks, people and other resources to accomplish the work
- Leading: inspiring people to work hard to achieve high performance
- Controlling: measuring performance and taking action to ensure desired results

#### Organising

Structuring an organization and creating conditions/systems where people/resources work to gether to achieve organizational goals:

- Resource allocation, task allocation, creating procedures, policies, processes
- Organizational structure with clear lines of authority/responsibility
- Recruitment, training
- Allocating employees where they will be most effective

#### Leading

Creating a vision and guiding/training/coaching/motivating others:

- Guiding/motivating others
- Giving assignments
- Explaining routines/procedures/policies
- Providing performance feedback

#### Planning

- Setting organizational goals
- Developing strategies
- Determining resources

#### Controlling

Determining if an organization is progressing towards goals/objectives, and taking corrective actions if required:

- Measuring results against objectives
- Monitoring performance relative to standards

- Taking corrective action

##### Management Skills

- Technical skills; applying expertise on technical tasks
- Human/interpersonal skills; working in cooperation with others

Higher level managers concentrate more on conceptual skills, but human skills are important regardless of level.

## How to Manage

### History

#### Classical Theories

Telling people what to do, motivating them with money.

##### Scientific Management

Improving the workers, watching the workers all the time to ensure they don't mess it up. Punish the bad, reward the good.

Engineering the most efficient production methods.

- Developing a science for each element of the job
- Selecting employees and training them to do the job as described
- Supervising employees to ensure they follow the prescribed methods
- Continue to plan the work but use workers to get the work done

Gaant chart: splitting tasks down into smallest components and showing dependencies.

#### Administrative Management

Improving the manager by applying 'universal principles' of efficient management.

- Henri Fayol, 5 duties of management: foresight, organization, command, coordination, control
- Mary Parker Follet: if you share goals with workers, they are likely to help and reduce management conflict
- Chester Barnard: ensuring overlap between natural/informal organization and organizational hierarchy; acceptance theory of authority

#### Bureaucratic Management

Improving efficiency by developing the 'ideal' organization.

Max Weber:

- Clear division of labour
- Clear hierarchy of authority
- Careers based on merit
- Formal rules and procedures
- Impersonality

#### Behavioural Management Theories

#### Quantitative Management Theories

Modern management theory

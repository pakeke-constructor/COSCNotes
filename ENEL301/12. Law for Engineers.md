## Making and Classification of Law

Two primary sources: parliament nd the courts.

### Parliament

Parliament is:

- NZ's legislative body
- One chamber of parliament with ~120 members
- Members elected on proportional basis

Parliament creates Acts of Parliament/statute.

However, *legislation* is a superset of statues, including regulations, rules and bylaws.

Regulations and rules: when parliament delegates law-making power to other government bodies.

Bylaws: laws delegated to local councils

### The Courts

Common law: decisions made by judges make the law. Judges refer to previous cases, making the law if there are no relevant cases.

Statutes becoming more significant over time with common law becoming a fallback.

Parliamentary sovereignty: Parliament can create statutes that override common law.

### Parliamentary Process

- Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts a bill
- The Cabinet - senior members of parliament (mostly government ministers) accept
- Most of the time, the minister in charge of the area
  - Most bills are government bills introduced by the governing party
  - Private members bills can be introduced by any MP
- First reading: MPs debate and vote on bill. If majority, bill directed to select committee
- Select committee, made up of non-minister MPs, seek advice from the public. Approx. 6 months
  - Urgency allows select committee be bypassed
- Second reading: select committee presents reports, Parliament debates report
- Committee of the Whole: whole house considers details
- Third reading, then votes
- Royal Assent: Governor-General (representative of the monarch) signs of statute
  - Has no power in practice
- Act of Parliament: in force

### NZ Courts

Basic hierarchy:

- Supreme Court
  - 5 judges
  - Hears appeals from the court of appeal
  - Only matters of public interest/complex law
- Court of Appeal
  - 3 or 5 judges (mostly 3)
  - Appeals on lower courts
- High Court
  - 1 judge
  - Hears appeals from lower courts
  - Serious crimes (e.g. murder)
  - Civil disputes of high value
  - Judicial review of ministers/decision makers
- District Court
  - 1 judge
  - Most criminal offences, including driving offences
  - Civil cases; disputes between people, where monetary value of dispute is lesser (~350,000 NZD or less)

### Classification of Law

International law: inter-state relations (Treaties, Conventions, etc.)

Public law: government/individual relations (e.g. crimes, traffic offences, tax, constitutional law, human rights, welfare)

Private law: individual/individual relations (e.g. contract law, negligence, land law)

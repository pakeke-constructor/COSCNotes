## Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

LCAs are a tool to evaluate the **environmental** performance of a product or service.

Standards available: ISO 14040, 14044.

LCAs quantity the environment impacts of a product/service over its **full life cycle**: material extraction/processing, production, packaging/distribution, use/end-of-life.

This can be quantified through many different indicators: carbon emissions, embodied energy, acidification, ecological footprint, water use, carcinogens etc.

Raw materials/resources converted to either *energy* or *materials*. Either way, emissions arise, going to air, water and ground.

'Classic' LCA questions:

- Drinking containers: glass bottles vs PET bottles vs aluminium cans
- Nappies: disposable or cotton
- Cars: EVs vs ICE
- Solar panels: does the embodied energy in a solar panel ever pay for itself

Why bother doing LCAs:

- As a design tool: project environmental impacts as you design a product
- Strategic planning: incorporate into product development to see if you are moving towards strategic goals
- Public policy development: government can use these assessments to determine which technologies it should subsidize
- Marketing: promote 'green' credentials

#### Goal and Scope Definition

Frame the study:

- Key methodological decisions
- What will be included/excluded from the study?
- Reasons for the study
  - What is the study about?
  - Why are you doing it?
  - What will you do with the results?
  - Who is the audience? Internal? External? Marketing?

Functional unit:

- Quantification of the primary function of the product or system
- Allows fair comparisons between systems
- e.g. soft-drink packaging
  - Main objective: to contain a liquid
  - Functional unit: delivering 1L (or a serving) of liquid to a consumer
- e.g. cars
  - Main objective: Transport of people
  - Functional unit: distance travelled times number of people
- e.g. solar panels
  - Main objective: generation of power
  - Functional unit: KWh of power generated

System boundary:

- Determining what processes will be included/excluded?
- Attempt to cover at least 95% of environmental impacts associated with the product life cycle
- Hard to know what you are missing; that's part of the reason you are doing the study
- Typically excludes:
  - Capital equipment/maintenance (depending on how much product goes through the machine)
  - Human labour (e.g. workers eating) (unless it is very labour-intensive work)
  - Accidents
- e.g.

What environmental indicators will you use?

- Should be relevant to the study
- Don't ignore known issues
- Look at what indicators have been used in similar studies
- Indicators:
  - Climate change potential
    - Called *potential* since we are modelling reality, not reality itself
    - Emissions of CO_2, CH_4, N_2O, SF_6, CFCs etc.
    - Often measured in kilograms of CO_2 equivalent
    - Carbon accounting methods (e.g. time horizons) may affect results
  - Photochemical oxidation (smog)
    - Air emissions of SO_x, NO_x, CO, etc.
    - Degradation of volatile organic compounds in the presence of light and NO_x
    - Measured in *photochomical ozone creation potential* (POCP) - kilograms of ethylene equivalents
  - Acidification
    - Air, soil and water emissions of SO_x, NO_x, HF, etc.
    - Release of acids or acid-forming compounds in terrestrial/aquatic systems
    - Measured in acidification potential - kilograms of S0_2 equivalents
  - Eutrophication/Nutrification
    - Air, soil and water emissions of NO_x, PO_x, etc.
    - Too many nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous) and not enough oxygen that leads to algal blooms
    - Measured in eutrophication potential - kilograms of PO_4^{3-} equivalents
  - Land use
    - Sum of land occupied over the life cycle
    - Ha/a: occupation over time
    - A poor proxy for land use impacts
    - Often coupled with soil, water use
  - Water use
    - Sum of water inputs over life cycle
    - Measured in kilo litres of water
    - Impact varies with location (e.g. west coast of NZ vs Australian deserts)
      - New methods developed to account of water scarcity
  - Minerals/fossil fuel depletion
    - Measure of pressure/strain on resource use
    - Different extraction measures additional energy/resources
  - Human toxicity
    - Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)
  - Plus a lot, lot, more

Identify data requirements:

- High quality data is essential
- Foreground data
  - Data from the original manufacturer (e.g. mass of packaging, energy inputs for a process, emissions)
- Background data
  - Data supplied by LCA practitioner (e.g. electricity generation, transport, production of common materials)
  - LCA databases available

#### Inventory Deployment

Document the inventory: report should be transparent and be specific enough that a reader can generate the same results.

LCA practitioner:

- Couple foreground/background data
- Run a preliminary assessment
- Look for gaps/errors

LCA commissioner:

- Often likes to view inventory
- Provide more data to fill in gaps

#### Impact Assessments

Must characterize the impacts.

May:

- Normalize the impacts relative to a known baseline
- Use weightings to reduce the data to a single or a few numbers

#### Interpretation

Iterate back to other steps:

- Identify reasons for your results
  - 5 whys: you should be able to ask 'why' for any question and the answers to those questions five questions
  - Check assumptions, data quality, methods

Sensitivity studies: determine effect of key assumptions on your outcomes.

Uncertainty studies: find the effects of data uncertainty on outcomes (Monte Carlo simulations).

### Basic LCA

$E = QF$ where:

- $E$ is the emissions from the emissions source in kg of CO_2 equivalents
- $Q$ is activity data: quantity of material used
- $F$ is emission factor for the emissions source

Process:

- Set the functional unit and system boundary
- Collect data
  - [Inventory of Carbon and Energy](https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon-footprint-database.html)
    - Basic emission factors for material production
    - NB: shaping processes (e.g. injection moulding plastic) may not be included
  - [MoE Carbon Accounting Guide](https://environment.govt.nz/assets/Publications/Files/Measuring-Emissions-Detailed-Guide-2020.pdf)
    - Emission factors for electricity/fuel use/transport
- Use the above equation, sum results
- Produce a report

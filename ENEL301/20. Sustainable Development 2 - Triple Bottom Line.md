# 20. Environmental Sustainability 2 - Triple Bottom Line

Sustainable practices cannot separate:

- Ethics
- Management
- Economic analysis
- Financial/management accounting

Hence, environmental sustainability is covered last in the course

Difficulties:

- Deeply values based: whose values?
- Sustainability cannot be measured in absolute terms
- How can environmental, social and economics impacts of two different proposals be compared?
- What are the minimum requirements? Rights, equity, greater good, etc.

Hence, we must ask: **How can we evaluate conflicting economic, environmental and social interests?**

## Triple Bottom Line Analysis

A cost-benefit analysis that takes into account environmental and social interests.

International standards and transparency are essential to ensure comparisons are valid; many standards exist.

Probably should be the *de facto* standard: Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

KPMG corporate responsibility reporting survey in 2017:

- CR reporting in NZ not great: only 69% of top-100 companies (by revenue)
- Only 35% of companies use the GRI or IR frameworks with the CR reports
  - Beware companies making up their own frameworks

### Environmental Impacts


Compliance-based sustainable engineering:

- Minimum acceptable behavior: is what you are doing legal?
- Legislation, regulation, policies, codes
- NZ: Resource Management Act (1991)
  - Avoid remedying/mitigating adverse impacts wherever possible
  - Currently being repealed, hopefully for the better

#### Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)/Assessments of Environmental Effects (AEE)

May be required by regulatory bodies or done voluntarily.

EIAs reports on **indicators** of impacts:

- Biology e.g. some species can act as canaries
- Physical e.g. noise, water quality
- Chemical e.g. metal concentrations

Standard methodologies should be used in EIAs to ensure credibility:

- GRI
- IAIA: evaluation done prior to major decisions/commitments being made
- Ministry for the Environment

Life cycle analysis:

- Material extraction/processing, manufacturing, distribution, product use, end of life
- Multiple standards: ISO 14000, IEC 62430

Potential metrics for environmental impacts:

- Resource intensity: sum of all resources/energy need to create, use and dispose a product
- Ecological footprint: estimated total surface area of arable land required to provide enough renewable resources to maintain a certain standard of living
- Carbon footprint: amount of greenhouse gases produced to support human activities

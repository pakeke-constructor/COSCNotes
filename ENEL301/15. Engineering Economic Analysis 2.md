# 15. Engineering Economic Analysis 2

Fundamental Principle of Financial Analysis:

> Risk expects appropriate return

Risk: measure of the potential variability of an outcome from its expected value

Return: money earned as a result of money spent

Low risk = low expected rate of return

Low risk + high expected rate of return = scam

The expected return on an investment provides compensation to investors both for the waiting (time value of money) and for worrying (risk of the investment).

90 day bank rate: lend money to bank for 90 days, bank guarantees it will return it with interest (almost the official cash rate).

Interest rates at banks almost nothing at the moment ~0.25% per annum.

## Risk and Diversification

Diversifiable/unsystematic/specific/unique risk: risk that you can mitigate by investing in a diverse range of funds. Compare this to non-diversifiable/systematic/market risk where you cannot mitigate the risk.

Markets, low to high risk:

- Bond market (debt market)
  - Government or private bonds
  - Air NZ issued six year, unsecured, fixed rate bonds at an interest rate of 4.25% in 2016. Covid was not kind to them
- Property market
  - Residential or commercial
- Equity market: shares
- Non-equity market: direct investment

Portfolio theory: diversification elimiates specific risk; for a reasonably diverse portfolio (8 or so reasonably different companies), the majority of specific risk is mitigated and only systematic risk matters.

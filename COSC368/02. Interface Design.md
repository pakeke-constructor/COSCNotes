# 02. Interface Design

Design -> Implementation -> Evaluation -> Design -> ...

## Design Process

Saul Greenberg

### Articulate

Articulate:

- Who the users are
- Their key tasks

Then design:

- Task-centred system design
- Participatory design
- User-centred design

This should lead to **user and task descriptions**.

Then, evaluate the tasks and repeat the process, refining goals.

### Brainstorm Designs

When designing, consider:

- The psychology of everyday thing
- User involvement
- Representation and metaphors

Create low-fidelity prototyping methods.

Then, create **throw-away paper prototypes**.

NB: 'prototype' has multiple meanings, one of which implies executability.

Evaluate the designs:

- With respect to the tasks identified
- Participant interaction: get users involved
- Task scenario walk-through: in order to do X, Mary will press this button ...

Repeat steps if required, further brainstorming more designs.

A reviewer should be able to unambiguously understand how the interface operates and works.

### Refined Designs

Create:

- Graphical screen design
- Interface guidelines
- Style guides

Then use high-fidelity prototype methods and create **testable prototypes**.

Use usability testing and heuristic evaluation to further refine design if required.

### Completed designs

Create alpha/beta systems or complete specifications. Do field testing if necessary.

## Iterative Design

Iteratively refine design based on evaluative feedback.

A common mistake is to get an idea and hill climb on that single idea. Leads to:

- Tunnel vision
- Premature commitment
- Local maxima
- Stops early bad decisions from being fixed

### Elaborative/Reduction Tension

Elaboration: get the Right Design; explore the full space of possible designs.

Reduction: get the Design Right; polish the solution. This may be done on the best solutions simultaneously.

### The Design Funnel

### Supporting *Rapid* Iterations

Fudd's first law of creativity: to get a good idea, get lots of ideas.

Lots of ideas take lots of time to build/test, so we need rapid creation, evaluation and prototyping.

## Prototyping

After user/task identification, prototyping can occur.

Low-fidelity paper prototypes (elaboration):

- Brainstorm different representations
- Choose a presentation
- Rough out interface style
- Task-centred walk-through and redesign

Medium-fidelity prototypes (reduction):

- Find tune interface, screen design
- Heuristic evaluation and redesign

High-fidelity prototypes/restricted systems:

- Usability testing and redesign

Working systems:

- Limited field testing
- Alpha/beta testing

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Sketches

Outward appearance and structure of intended design.

Necessarily crude and scruffy:

- Focus on high-level concepts
- Fast to develop
- Fast to change
- Low change resistance; you only put in a few minutes of effort
- Delays commitment

Use annotations/sequences to show UI progression.

Cross reference with other zoomed in/out sketches.

Sequential sketches: show state transitions; what interaction causes the state change?

Focus on the *main* transactions (Zipf's law) - clearly convey how the user achieves the 20% of the most frequent interactions.

### Medium-Fidelity Prototypes: Wizard of Oz

Have a person emulate the functionality.

IBM speech editor (1984): user would give audible commands to edit a text document, which the wizard implement. This gave IBM a good understanding of the user experience, allowing them to see if the idea was any good without investing a large amount of effort into actually implementing it.

Walkthrough evaluation:

- Facilitator gives the user tasks and prompts them for their thoughts
- User looks at current system state
- Component updates system state following some pre-determined algorithm
  - All UI states/components must be sketched/printed out
- Observer takes notes

Refinement (e.g. PowerPoint):

- Facilitates motion paths
- Links between states etc.
- Many wireframing tools available (eg. moqups, blsamiq, axure)

Precise medium-fidelity prototypes:

- For very small but important portions of the UI
  - e.g. slide to unlock animations etc.

Photo traces:

- If you suck at sketching
- Take a photo, trace it out; captures **the essence of the interaction** without the exact representation

Simulations and animations:

- Works well for second round evaluation
- **Horizontal prototype**: surface-layer/sketch prototype of entire range of functionality
- **Vertical prototype**: much of the functionality for a small set of features
- **Scenario**: intersection of horizontal and vertical prototypes
- Beware of:
  - Inflated expectations - perception of it being 'nearly completed'
  - Reluctance to change - the more it looks finished, the less willing stakeholders may be to recommend changes
  - Excessive focus on presentation rather than approach

## Task-Centered System Design (TCSD)

TCSD is the HCI equivalent of requirements analysis/use cases.

It asks **Exactly and specifically** who are the users and what will they use the system for? There is a critical difference between:

- The User - a pretend person who will adapt to the system and go on a two week training session to live with the designer's pet system
- A real, busy person doing their job

TCSD acts as a reality-based sanity check for designers.

Good book on system design: [Task-Centered User Interface Design by Clayton Lewis and John Rieman](https://hcibib.org/tcuid/).

How NOT to approach design:

- Focus on system and designer needs
- Ask what can we easily build
- Ask what is possible/easy with the tools we know/have?
- Ask the programmer what they find interesting?

### UC SMS

UC's student management system (from the mid 2000s) was a multi-million dollar, unusable disaster.

Example task: Andy is teaching COSC225 next semester; he wants to know how many students are enrolled to see how many printouts he needs. To achieve this:

- Click on 'Navigate' button in the toolbar; opens 'System Navigator' window
- Expand 'Searches' menu (hierarchical menu system)
- Click on 'Course Occurrence Search'; opens new window
- Enter course code, hit return
- Select the right occurrence
- A window with a huge mess of text fields (mostly disabled) and 13 tabs opens
- ...

The company that delivered it had a system that was similar to what UC needed; they did what was easy, not what the end user needed.

### TCSD Phase 1: User Identification

Identify categories of end-users with specific exemplars - typical and extremes.

Talk to them!

- If they won't give you the time to talk to you, they probably won't use your system either
- If they really don't exist (no existing system):
  - Worry
  - Describe your assumed users and tasks
- Learn about people in the task chain: who do inputs come from, where do outputs go?
  - Why does the user need to do this? What do they do with the information?

### TCSD Phase 2: Task Identification

1. Record what the user wants to do, *minimizing the description of how they do it*
    - No interface assumptions; tasks are independent of the interface they will use to complete it
    - Can be used to compare alternative designs
2. Record the complete task: input source, output identification
3. Identify users
    - Design success depends on what users know
    - Test against specific individuals; name names
4. Uniquely enumerate tasks for identification
    - Giving tasks a unique identifier helps with communicating problematic tasks with the team
5. Identified tasks can be circulated for validations
    - Interview the users with the tasks you identified; they can help spot omissions, corrections, clarifications and unrealistic tasks
6. Identify broad coverage of users and tasks
    - Create matrix with the axes of unimportant/important and infrequent/frequent tasks/users

Example: John Smith arrives at student services trying to enrol in a course online, but refused as he lacked a pre-requisite course. He has a letter from the HoD allowing him to enrol. He has forgotten his ID card and cannot remember his student ID or user code (<- this is an interface assumption; does the system have IDs or user codes?).

### TCSD Phase 1/2 Outcomes

A report should state:

1. User categories (and their priorities)
2. Specific personas exemplifying each category
3. Task categories and priorities
4. Concrete representative task scenarios (with name of the owner)
    - Enumerated with unique identifiers for use in UI validation
5. Explicit identification of groups/tasks that will not be supported and reasons for this

### TCSD Phase 3: Design

Use task categories/scenarios to *generate* and *evaluate* designs.

Strive to make the workflow natural to the user. For each design and task scenario ask how the user would complete the task.

#### TCSD Phase 4: Walk-through Evaluation

Interface design debugging: select a task scenario and for each step:

- Ask what the user would do given what they know
- Ask if the story is believable
- If not, it is an interface bug. Record it and assume it is fixed when going through the next steps

#### Cautions on TCSD

- It is hard to record and identify task scenarios that are independent of the interface
- The more the interface and task are interlinked, the more difficult it is to identify alternative/better ways of achieving the task
- It can be hard to find people 'responsible' for new tasks in a system: who do you interview, how do you validate the interface?

## User-Centred System Design

**Know the user**

Design should be based around user needs, abilities, context, tasks etc. and should be involved in all stages of design: requirements, analysis, storyboards, prototypes etc.

### UCSD/Participative Design: Involving the User

Talk to users:

- Interview them about culture, requirements, expectations
- Contextual inquiry: observe them doing their job; a few hours of observations can give a lot of insight
- Explain designs: get input at all stages, show visual prototypes and demos
- Walk-throughs: the user knows what they will do the best

### UCSD: Participatory Design

Problem:

- Designers' intuitions can be wrong
- Interviews lack precision/context and can mislead
- Designers cannot know user needs well enough to answer all questions that are likely to arise during design

Solution:

- Designers having access to a pool of representative end users: not management; real users
- These users are **full members of the design process**

The users:

- Are excellent at responding to suggested designs (they must be concrete and visible)
- Bring in important knowledge of work context that only someone that has lived in the role can learn
- Will often have greater buy-in into the system

However:

- It is difficult (and expensive) to get a good pool of representative end users - you are taking people out of their regular jobs
- They are not expert designers - they probably won't be able to come up with design ideas from scratch with an understanding of the constraints of the technology, budget, time etc.
- The user is not always right - they may not know what they want

Erskine: member of Math/COSC departments became members of the design and judging team, gave suggestions to architects etc. (e.g. less glass - too much glare). When finished the staff had buy-in into the building; it was *their* building, not one built by management.

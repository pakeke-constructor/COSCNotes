# 02. Interface Design

Design -> Implementation -> Evaluation -> Design -> ...

## Design Process

Saul Greenberg

### Articulate

Articulate:

- Who the users are
- Their key tasks

Then design:

- Task-centered system design
- Participatory design
- User-centered design

This should lead to **user and task descriptions**.

Then, evaluate the tasks and repeat the process, refining goals.

### Brainstorm Designs

When designing, consider:

- The psychology of everyday thing
- User involvement
- Representation and metaphors

Create low-fidelity prototyping methods.

Then, create **throw-away paper prototypes**.

NB: 'prototype' has multiple meanings, one of which implies executability.

Evaluate the designs:

- With respect to the tasks identified
- Participant interaction: get users involved
- Task scenario walk-through: in order to do X, Mary will press this button ...

Repeat steps if required, further brainstorming more designs.

A reviewer should be able to unambiguously understand how the interface operates and works.

### Refined Designs

Create:

- Graphical screen design
- Interface guidelines
- Style guides

Then use high-fidelity prototype methods and create **testable prototypes**.

Use usability testing and heuristic evaluation to further refine design if required.

### Completed designs

Create alpha/beta systems or complete specifications. Do field testing if necessary.

## Iterative Design

Iteratively refine design based on evaluative feedback.

A common mistake is to get an idea and hill climb on that single idea. Leads to:

- Tunnel vision
- Premature commitment
- Local maxima
- Stops early bad decisions from being fixed

### Elaborative/Reduction Tension

Elaboration: get the Right Design; explore the full space of possible designs.

Reduction: get the Design Right; polish the solution. This may be done on the best solutions simultaneously.

### The Design Funnel

```
                                          _______
                                   ------/
-----                   /---------/    Sales

    ---   Management/Marketing ----------\_______
       \_________________________________________

       /------/                 |----------------
    --- /|              --------|
---/  -- | Engineering /
-----/   |----/-------/

```

### Supporting *Rapid* Iterations

Fudd's first law of creativity: to get a good idea, get lots of ideas.

Lots of ideas take lots of time to build/test, so we need rapid creation, evaluation and prototyping.

## Prototyping

After user/task identification, prototyping can occur.

Low-fidelity paper prototypes (elaboration):

- Brainstorm different representations
- Choose a presentation
- Rough out interface style
- Task-centered walk-through and redesign

Medium-fidelity prototypes (reduction):

- Find tune interface, screen design
- Heuristic evaluation and redesign

High-fidelity prototypes/restricted systems:

- Usability testing and redesign

Working systems:

- Limited field testing
- Alpha/beta testing

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Sketches

Outward appearance and structure of intended design.

Necessarily crude and scruffy:

- Focus on high-level concepts
- Fast to develop
- Fast to change
- Low change resistance; you only put in a few minutes of effort
- Delays commitment

Use annotations/sequences to show UI progression.

Cross reference with other zoomed in/out sketches.

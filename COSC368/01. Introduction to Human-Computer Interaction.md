# 01. Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction

Andy Cockburn: Room 313, working Thursdays and Fridays

Tutors: `team368@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz`

Course breakdown:

- Labs: 9%, 1% per lab
- Usability analysis and storyboard
  - 25%, 5pm 22 September
- Design specification and rationale
  - 15%, 5pm 20 October
- Exam: 51%

Goals:

- Understand key human factors influencing HCI
- Know and apply guidelines, models, methods that aid in interface design

HCI: discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use.

There should be a cycle of evaluating, designing and implementation.

## Usability

Three key pillars:

- Learnability: rapid attainment of some level of performance
  - Can be modelled as the inverse of time spent on the interface
- Efficiency: can get a lot of work done per unit time
- Subjective satisfaction: how much you enjoy using it

Two minor pillars:

- Errors: should be few errors in an efficient interface.
- Memorability: should be memorable if the interface is learnable.

Trade-offs: efficiency and learnability (inverse of time spent) are often at odds with each other. The performance/efficiency ceiling is often lower for more learnable interfaces.

### Preliminary Factors

- Safety considerations
- Need for throughput (efficiency)
- Frequency of use
- Physical space, lighting, noise, pollution
- Social context
- Cognitive factors: age, fatigue, stress, focus

Usability is like oxygen: you only notice it when it's absent. See: doors with handles that you need to push.

### Managing Complexity

The job of HCI is to manage complexity: designing an object to be simple and clear; **the relentless pursuit of simplicity**.

### Models

Models are **simplifications of reality** that (should) help with the understanding of a complex artifact.

#### Don Norman's Model of Interaction

From 'The Psychology/Design of Everyday Things', 1988.

This helps understand the designer's role in creating a system that is used by a thinking person.

```
               constructs
   Designer  -------------> System
                              ^
                     Provides | Provides input based on
                    feedback/ | their prediction of how
                     output   | to achieve their goal
                              v
                             User
```

The designer tries to construct a system that they have **not fully defined**. The *designer's model* is their *conception of interaction*; often incomplete and fuzzy.

The system projects to the user the *system image*; this is how the system *appears* to be used, and hence does not necessarily reflect the true implementation of the system.

The *user model* begins very weak, coming from familiarity with the real world. They will use this experience to try and interact with the user system, building their model based on *feedback* from the system.

Ideally, there should be conformance between the system and user models.

Assume there is no communication between the designer and user; who reads documentation? Hence, any mismatches

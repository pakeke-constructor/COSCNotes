# 03. Number Theory and Finite Fields

Discrete mathematics: cyroptology deals with finite objects (e.g. alphabets, blocks of characters)

Modular arithmetic; deals with finite number of values.

## Basic Number Theory

### Factorization

$\mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$ is the set of integers.

Given $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $a$ divides $b$ if there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $ak = b$. In this case, $a$ is a *factor* of $b$: $a|b$.

An integer $p > 1$ is prime iff its only divisors are $1$ and $p$.

#### Properties

If $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$.

If $p$ is prime and $p|ab$, $p|a$ OR $p|b$.

#### Division algorithm

Given $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a > b$, then there exists $q, r \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that:

$$
a = bq + r
$$

$q$ is the *quotient* and $0 \ge r \gt b$ is the *remainder*. $r \lt \frac{a}{2}$.

### Greatest Common Divisor

$d$ is the GCD of $a$ and $b$; $gcd(a, b) = d$ if:

- $d|a$ and $|b$
- If $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|d$
- $d \gt 0$

$a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $gcd(a, b) = 1$

#### Euclidean Algorithm

To find $d = gcd(a, b)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a   &= bq_1   + r_1 \text{ for } 0 \gt r_1 \gt b   \\
b   &= r_1q_2 + r_2 \text{ for } 0 \gt r_2 \gt r_1 \\
r_1 &= r_2q_3 + r_3 \text{ for } 0 \gt r_3 \gt r_2 \\

& \dots \\

r_{k - 2} &= r_{k - 1}q_k + r_k \text{ for } 0 \gt r_k \gt r_{k - 1} \\
r_{k - 1} &= r_kq_{k + 1} \text{ with } r_{k + 1} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, $d = r_k = gcd(a, b)$.

In psuedo-code:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
  r[-1] = a
  r[0] = b
  k = 0
  while r[k] != 0:
    q[k] = floor(r[k - 1]/r[k])
    r[r + 1] = r[k - 1] - q[k]r[k]
    k = k + 1
  
  k = k - 1
  return r[k]
```

##### Back-Substitution

Find $x$, $y$ in $ax + by = d = r_k$.

$$
r_{k - 3} = r_{k - 2}q_{k - 1} + r_{k - 1}
$$

Can be rewritten as:

$$
r_{k - 1} = r_{k - 3} - r_{k - 2}q_{k - 1}
$$

$r_{k - 2} = r_{k - 1}q_k + r_k$ can be rewritten as $r_k = r_{k - 2} - r_{k - 1}q_k$. $r_{k - 1}$ can be substituted with the value above. Hence, this process can be repeated until you have $r_{k - 1}$ in terms of the original values.

Example: $gcd(17, 3)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
17 &= 3 \times 5 + 2 \\
3  &= 2 \times 1 + 1 \\
2  &= 1 \times 2
\end{aligned}
$$

Back-substitution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 &= 3 - 2                 \times 1 \\
  &= 3 - (17 - 3 \times 5) \times 1 \\
  &= 17 \times - 1 + 3 \times 6
\end{aligned}
$$

### Modular Arithmetic

$b$ is a *residue* of $a \pmod n$ if $a - b = kn$ for some integer $k$:

$$
a \equiv b \pmod n \Longleftrightarrow a - b = kn
$$

Given $a \equiv b \pmod n$ and $c \equiv d \pmod n$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a + c &\equiv b + d \pmod n \\
ac &\equiv bd \pmod n \\
ka &\equiv kb \pmod n
\end{aligned}
$$

$b \pmod n$ denotes the **unique** value $a$ in the complete set of residues $\{ 0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ such that:

$$
a \equiv b \pmod n
$$

In other words, $b \pmod n$ is the remainder after dividing $a$ by $n$.

#### Residue Class

The set $\{ r_0, r_1, \dots, r_{n - 1}\}$ is a *complete* set of residues modulo $n$ if for every $a \in \mathbb{N}$, $a \equiv r_i \pmod n$ for **exactly one** $r_i$.

The set $\{ 0, 1, \dots, n - 1\}$ is denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

### Groups

A group $\mathbb{G}$ is a set with binary operation $\cdot$ and:

- *Closure*: $a \cdot b \in \mathbb{G}$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{G}$
- *Identity*: there is an element $1$ such that $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$ for $a \in \mathbb{G}$
- *Inverse*: there is an element $b$ such that $a \cdot b = 1$ for $a \in \mathbb{G}$
- *Associativity*: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for $a, b, c \in \mathbb{G}$

A group is *abelian* when it is the operation is *commutative*; $a \cdot b = b\cdot a$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{G}$.

#### Cyclic Groups

The order $|\mathbb{G}|$ of a group $\mathbb{G}$ is the number of elements in $\mathbb{G}$.

$g^k$ denotes the repeated application of $g \in \mathbb{G}$ using the group operation. e.g. $g^3 = g \cdot g \cdot g$.

The order $g$ of $g \in \mathbb{G}$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $g^k = 1$.

$g$ is a generator for $\mathbb{G}$ if $|g| = |\mathbb{G}|$.

A group is *cyclic* if it has a generator.

#### Computing Inverses Modulo $n$

The inverse if $a$ (if it exists) is a value $x$ such that $ax \equiv 1 \pmod n$; it is written as $a^{-1} \pmod n$. This means that **$a$ must be coprime to $n$.

Theorem: let $0 \gt a \gt n$; $a$ **has an inverse modulo $n$ iff $gcd(a, n) = 1$**.

The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the inverse of $a$.

If $x$ such that $ax \equiv 1 \pmod n$, there is an integer $y$ such that $ax = 1 + yn$.

Hence, starting from $gcd(a, n) = 1$, use back substitution to find $x$ and $y$ in the equation $ax + ny = 1$. the $y$ value gives the inverse.

#### Group of Primes Modulus $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$

$\mathbb{Z}^*_p = {1, 2, \dots, p - 1}$ is a complete set of residues modulo the prime $p$ with the value $0$ removed.

Properties:

- $|\mathbb{Z}^*_p| = p - 1$
- $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$ is cyclic
- $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$ has many generators (in general)

It can be thought of as the multiplicative group of integers $1, 2, \dots, p - 1$ which have inverses modulo $p$.

##### Finding Generators

A generator of $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$ is an element of order $p - 1$

**Lagrange theorem**: the order of any element must exactly divide $p - 1$.

To find a generator of $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$:

- Compute all distinct prime factors $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_r$ of $p - 1$
- $g$ is a generator iff $g^\frac{p - 1}{f_i} \neq 1 \pmod p$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots, r$

###### Example

Find a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_{11}^*$.

$|\mathbb{Z}_{11}^*|$ is $10$ as $11$ is prime. $10 = 2 \cdot 5$, so to check if $g \in \mathbb{Z}_{11}^*$ is a generator, check if $g^2 \not\equiv 1 \pmod 11$, $g^5 \not\equiv 1 \pmod 11$:

- $1$: not a generator as $1^n \equiv 1 \pmod 11$
- $2$: $2^5 \equiv 32 \equiv 2 \not\equiv 1 \pmod 11$ and $2^2 \equiv 4 \not\equiv 1 \pmod 11$ so $2$ is a generator

#### Groups of Composite Modulus $\mathbb{Z}^*_p$

For any non-prime $n$, $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is a group of residues that have an inverse under multiplication.

Properties:

- $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is a group
- $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ is not cyclic in general
- Finding its order is difficult

e.g. $\mathbb{Z}_6^* = \{1, 5\}$ (elements coprime to $6$).

###### Example

Find a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_9^*$.

$\mathbb{Z}_9^* = \{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, \}$ so $|\mathbb{Z}_9^*| = 6$

- $1$: not a generator as $1^n \equiv 1 \pmod 9$
- $2$:
  - $2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod 9$
  - $2^3 \equiv 8 \pmod 9$
  - $2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 7 \pmod 9$
  - $2^5 \equiv 32 \equiv 5 \pmod 9$
  - $2^6 \equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod 9$
  - $2^7 \equiv 128 \equiv 2 \pmod 9$
  - Hence, the order of $2$ is equal to $|\mathbb{Z}_9^*|$, cycling through all elements in the group before repeating
  - NB: every element is guaranteed to be in $\mathbb{Z}_9^*$ as it is a group and hence has closure over the multiplication operation

### Fields

A field $\mathbb{F}$ is a set with binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and:

- $\mathbb{F}$ is an abelian group under the operation $+$ with the identity element $0$
- $\mathbb{F} \backslash \{ 0 \}$ is an abelian group under the operation $\cdot$ with identity element $1$
- Distributivity: $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ for $a, b, c \in \mathbb{F}$

Theorem: only finite fields of size $p^n$ exist, where $p$ is a prime and $n$ any positive integers.

#### Finite Field $GF(p)$

For a finite field $GF(p) = \mathbb{Z}_p$:

- Multiplication and addition are done modulo $p$
- Its multiplicative group is exactly $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$

##### Finite Field $GF(2)$

$GF(2)$ is the simplest field with two elements, $0$ and $1$:

- Addition modulo $2$: XOR ($\oplus$)
- Multiplicative group: $\{ 1 \}$

##### Finite Field $GF(2^8)$

$GF(2^8)$ is the field used for calculations in AES (block cipher).

Arithmetic in this field is considered as polynomial arithmetic where the field elements are polynomials with binary coefficients. e.g. $0010 1101 \leftrightarrow x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + 1$

Properties:

- Polynomial division can be done easily using shift registers
- Adding two strings: add their coefficients modulo $2$ (XOR)
- Multiplication with respect to a generator polynomial
  - AES uses $m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1$
- Multiplying two strings: multiply them as polynomials, then take remainder of division by $m(x)$

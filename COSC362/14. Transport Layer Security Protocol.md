# 14. Transport Layer Security Protocol

The most widely used security protocol.

History:

- SSL 2.0 developed by Netscape in 1994, 3.0 in 1995
- Standardized as RFC 2246 in 1999, called TLS 1.0
- TLS 1.1 (4346) in 2006, fix issues with non-random IVs, weaknesses from padding
- (the below are good to use)
- TLS 1.2 (5246) in 2008 allows standard authenticated encryption
- TLS 1.3 (8446) in 2018 had major changes and separated key agreement and authentication algorithms

## Overview

Three higher-level protocols:

- TLS handshake protocol
- TLS alert protocol signals events
- TLS change cipher spec protocol for changing cryptographic algorithm (not available in TLS 1.3)

TLS record protocol provides basic services to the higher-level protocols. Stack:

```
|----------------------------------------|
| TLS       | TLS change |  TLS  | HTTP/ |
| Handshake |   cipher   | alert | Other |
|----------------------------------------|
|           TLS record protocol          |
|----------------------------------------|
|                  TCP                   |
|----------------------------------------|
|                  IP                    |
|----------------------------------------|
```

## TLS Record Protocol

TLS offers:

- Message confidentiality - message contents cannot be read in transit
- Message integrity - receiver can detect modifications made to the message in transit

Services possibly provided by a symmetric encryption algorithm (confidentiality) and MAC (authentication/integrity).

TLS 1.2 and above offer authenticated encryption modes (CCM, GCM), combining these two services into one.

The handshake protocol establishes the symmetric session keys used by these mechanisms.

### Format

```
                HEADER
|--------------------------------------|
| Content |  Major  |  Minor  | Length |
|  type   | version | version |        |
|--------------------------------------|

          ENCRYPTED CONTENTS
|--------------------------------------|
|              Plaintext               |
|        (possibly compressed)         |
|      (not available in TLS 1.3)      |
|--------------------------------------|
|                 MAC                  |
|  (unless authentication encryption)  |
|--------------------------------------|
```

Content type contains acn be `change-cipher-spec`, `alert`, `handshake` or `application-data`.

Major version is `3` for TLS and minor version `1` to `4` for TLS 1.0 to 1.3.

Length of data is in octets.

### Operation

- Each application-layer message is $2^{14}$ bytes or less
- Compression removed in TLS 1.3 after attacks discovered, null by default in TLS 1.2
- Authenticated data: data, header and implicit record sequence number
- Plaintext: data and MAC (unless using authenticated encryption)
- Session keys: established in handshake protocol
  - One key for each of MAC and encryption
  - A single key if using authenticated encryption
- Specification: encryption/MAC algorithms specified in negotiated cipher suite

MAC algorithm:

- SHA-2 allowed in TLS 1.2 and above
- MD5 and SHA-1 not supported in TLS 1.3

Encryption algorithm:

- Block cipher in CBC or a stream cipher
- Most common block cipher is AES
- 3DES and RC4 not supported in TLS 1.3
- For block ciphers, padding is applied after the MAC to get complete blocks

Authenticated encryption algorithm:

- Allowed instead of separate encryption and MAC algorithms in TLS 1.2 and above
- TLS 1.3 supports only AES with either CCM or GCM modes
- Authenticated data in header and implicit record sequence number

## TLS Handshake Protocol

For:

- Negotiating the TLS version and cryptographic algorithms used
- Establishing a shared session key for use in the record protocol
- Authenticating the server and optionally authenticating the client

Many variations supported - many were dropped to in TLS 1.3.

### Phases

- Phase 1: initiating the logical connection and establishing the capabilities of the partner
- Phases 2 and 3: performing the key exchange
  - Operation depends on the handshake variant negotiated in phase 1
- Phase 4: completing setup

### Cipher Suites

Specify the public key algorithms used for key establishment and symmetric algorithms used for authenticated encryption/key computation.

There were over 300 standardized cipher suites, many of which were discarded in TLS 1.3.

TLS 1.3 requires cipher suites to be Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).

e.g. TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA:

- Mandatory in TLS 1.0/1.1
- RSA for key exchange
- 3DES in CBC mode for encryption (confidentiality)
- SHA-1 for HMAC (data integrity)

Handshake algorithms:

- DHE-DSS: Diffie-Hellman key Exchange with Digital Signature Standard/Algorithm (TLS 1.2 only)
- DHE-RSA: Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman with RSA signatures (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- ECDHE-RSA: Elliptic Curve DHE with RSA signatures (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- ECDHE-ECDSA: Elliptic Curve DHE with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (TLS 1.2/1.3)

Record algorithms:

- AES-CBC-SHA256: AES in CBC mode, SHA256 HMAC (TLS 1.2)
- AES-GCM: AES in GCM mode for authenticated encryption (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- CHACHA20-POLY1305: ChaCha stream cipher with Poly1305 MAC (TLS 1.2/1.3)

Forwards Secrecy:

- Compromise of a long-term key should not lead to compromise of session keys established prior to the compromise
- Diffie-Hellman handshakes offer forwards secrecy, but RSA-based handshakes do not. Hence, TLS 1.3 drops support for static RSA

#### Handshake

- Phase 1: client/server negotiate TLS version, cipher suite and compression, and exchange nonces
- Phase 2: server sends certificate and key exchange message (if required by cipher suite)
- Phase 3: client sends certificate and key exchange message (if required by cipher suite)
- Phase 4: secure communications. Finished messages also include check value (pseudorandom function) of all previous messages

Client hello (phase 1):

- Highest TLS version supported
- Cipher suites supported
- Client nonce $N_C$

Server hello (phase 1):

- Selected TLS version and cipher suite
- Server nonce $N_S$

Server key exchange (phase 2):

- Server inputs to key exchange

Client key exchange (phase 3):

- Client inputs to key exchange

Change cipher suite (phase 4):

- Use negotiated cipher suite for record layer

#### Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Handshake Variant

Server key exchange; server sends:

- Diffie-Hellman generator
- Group parameters (e.g. $P$)
- Server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman value

The response is signed by the server.

Client key exchange; server sends: ephemeral Diffie-Hellman value. Signed if the client certificate is used.

**Pre-master secret** ($pms$) is the shared Diffie-Hellman secret that both parties have computed from the key exchange.

#### RSA Handshake Variant

Server key exchange: none.

Client key exchange: key transport of the randomly pre-master secret $pms$, encrypted with server's public key.

#### Other Handshake Variants

Diffie-Hellman: static/fixed Diffie-Hellman with certified keys. If the client does not have a certificate, they use an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key.

Anonymous Diffie-Hellman: ephemeral Diffie-Hellman, but keys are not signed at all - only protects against passive eavesdropping.

### Session Key Generation

Master secret $ms$ generated using the pre-master secret and a pseudorandom function $\mathrm{PRF}$:

$$
ms = \mathrm{PRF}(pms, \text{\textquotedblleft master secret\textquotedblright}, N_C \| N_S)
$$

The $pms$ to $ms$ conversion is required to ensure the $ms$ is in the right format as $pms$ may vary depending on the key transfer algorithm.

To generate the key material (the amount depends on cipher suite):

$$
k = \mathrm{PRF}(ms, \text{\textquotedblleft key expansion\textquotedblright}, N_C \| N_S)
$$

Independent session keys are partitioned from $k$ in each direction; a write key and a read key are used on each side.

Depending on cipher suite, key material ma include encryption key, MAC key and IV.

The $\mathrm{PRF}$ is built from a HMAC specified by the TLS standard - SHA-2 in TLS 1.2 and a combination of MD5 and SHA-1 in TLS 1.0/1.1.

e.g. for TLS 1.2:

$$
A(i) = \begin{cases}
  \text{nonce},                        & i = 0 \\
  \mathrm{HMAC}(\text{key}, A(i - 1)), & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{PRF}(\text{key}, \text{label}, \text{nonce}) =

  & \mathrm{HMAC}(\text{key}, A(1) \| \text{label} \| \text{nonce}) \| \\
  & \mathrm{HMAC}(\text{key}, A(2) \| \text{label} \| \text{nonce}) \| \\
  & \vdots
\end{aligned}
$$

## TLS Alert Protocol

Alert messages of varying degrees of severity:

- Warning alerts
- `close_notify` alerts
- Fatal alerts

If alert messages are handled improperly, users may be vulnerable to truncation attacks.

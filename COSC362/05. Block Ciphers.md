# 05. Block Ciphers

Main bulk encryption algorithms used in commercial applications. AES is one example of such algorithm.

## Principles

Block ciphers are symmetric key ciphers where each block of plaintext encrypted with the **same** key.

A block is a set of plaintext symbols of a fixed size, typically 64 to 256 bits in modern ciphers.

They are used in configurations called *modes of operation*.

### Notation

- $P$: plaintext block of length $n$ bits
- $C$: ciphertext block of length $n$ bits
- $K$: key of length $k$ bits
- Encryption: $C = E(P, K)$
- Decryption: $P = D(C, K)$

### Criteria

*Confusion*: substitution used to make the relationship between $K$ and C$ as complex as possible.

*Diffusion*: transformations used to dissipate the statistical properties of $P$ across $C$.

Repeated use of techniques can be used using the concept of a *product cipher*.

## Product & Iterated Ciphers

### Product Cipher

Cryptosystem where encryption performed by applying/composing several sub-encryption algorithms: output of one block used as input to next block.

Often composed of simple functions $f_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$ such that each $f_i$ has its own key $K_i$.

$$
C = E(P, K) = f_r(\dots(f_2(f_1(P, K_1), K_2)\dots), K_r)
$$

### Iterated Cipher

Special product ciphers called *iterated ciphers* where:

- Encryption divided into $r$ similar *rounds*
- Sub-encryption functions are the same function $g$: the *round function*
- Each *round key*/*subkey* $K_i$ is derived from the master key $K$ using a process called *key schedule*

#### Encryption

Given plaintext block $P$, round function $g$, round keys $K-1, K_2, \dots, K_r$, the ciphertext block $C$ is derived through $r$ rounds:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_0 &= P \\
W_1 &= g(W_0, K_1) \\
W_2 &= g(W_1, K_2) \\
\dots
W_r &= g(W_{r - 1}, K_r) = C
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Decryption

There must be an inverse function $g^{-1}$ such that $g^{-1}(g(W, K_i), K_i) = W$ for all keys $K_i$ and blocks $W$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_r &= C \\
W_{r - 1} &= g^{-1}(W_r, K_r) \\
W_{r - 2} &= g^{-1}(W_{r - 1}, K_{r - 1}) \\
\dots
W_0 &= g^{-1}(W_1, K_r) = P
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Types of Iterated Ciphers

*Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)* e.g. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

*Feistel Cipher* e.g. Data Encryption Standard (DES).

##### Substitution-Permutation Network

Block length $n$ must allow each block to be split into $m$ sub-blocks of length $l$: $n = lm$.

Substitution $\pi_S$ (called substitution box or S-box) operates on sub-blocks of length $l$ bits:

$$
\pi_S: \{ 0, 1 \}^l \rightarrow \{ 0, 1 \}^l
$$

i.e. mapping some binary number of size $l$ bits to another.

Permutation $\pi_P$ (called permutation-box or P-box) swaps the inputs from $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$:

$$
\pi_P: \{ 1, \dots, n \} \rightarrow \{ 1, \dots, n \}
$$

i.e. swapping the order of bits in the entire block around.

#### Operation

1. Round key $K_i$ XORed with current state block $W_i$: $K_i \oplus W_i$
2. Each sub-block substituted applying $\pi_S$
3. The whole block permuted using $\pi_P$

#### Example

[![Substitution-Permutation Network](./SubstitutionPermutationNetwork2.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SubstitutionPermutationNetwork2.png)

- 4 round keys
- 4 S-boxes
- 1 P-box
- Last round does have a P-block

#### Feistel Cipher

Round function swaps the two halves of the block to form a new right hand half.

##### Encryption

![Feistel Cipher Network](./FeistelCipher.png)

Plaintext block $P = W_0$ split into two halves $(L_0, R_0)$.

For each round:

- $L_i = R_{i - 1}$
- $R_i = L_{i - 1} \oplus f(R_{i - 1}, K_i)$

The output is the ciphertext block $C = W_R = (L_r, R_r)$.

##### Decryption

Split $C$ into two halves, $(L_r, R_r)$.

For each round:

- $L_{i - 1} = R_i \oplus f(L_i, K_i)$
- $R_{i - 1} = L_i$

$f$ does not need to be inverted: $x \oplus x = 0$, so applying by applying $f$ twice it can be decrypted.

The choice of $f$ is critical for security; is is the only non-linear part of the encryption.

### Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis

Differential cryptanalysis: chosen plaintext attack using correlation in the differences between two input plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts.

Liner cryptanalysis: known plaintext attack that theoretically break DES.

Modern block ciphers normally immune to both attacks.

### Avalanche Effects

Key avalanche: a small change in key (with the same plaintext) should result in a large change in ciphertext.

Plaintext avalanche: a small change in plaintext should result in a large change in ciphertext: changing one bit should change all bits in the ciphertext with a probability of $1/2$.

Key avalanche is related to Shannon's notion of confusion, plaintext avalanche to Shannon's notion of diffusion.

## DES

Designed by IBM researchers, became US standard in 1976. 16-round Feistel cipher with key length of 56 bits and data block length of 64 bits.

### Encryption

$P$ is an input plaintext block of 64 bits:

1. All bits of $P$ permuted using an initial fixed permutation of $IP$
2. 16 rounds of Feistel operations applied, denoted by function $f$
    - Each round uses a different 48-bit subkey
    - The subkey is defined by a series of permutations and shifts
3. A final fixed inverse permutation $IP^{-1}$ is applied

The 64-bit ciphertext block $C$ is the output.

Decryption requires only reversing the order in which the subkeys are applied.

#### Feistel Operation

1. 32 bits expanded to 48 bits using a padding scheme which repeats some bits
2. XOR the 48 bits with the 48-bit subkey
3. Break 48 bits into 8 blocks of 6 bits
4. Each block $W_i$ transformed using substitution table $S_i$, resulting in blocks of length $4$ and hence a total of 32 bits.
    - A transformation table is used to determine the output value
    - If the input block is $W = x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6$, the row number is given by $x_1x_6$ and the column number by $x_2x_3x_4x_5$
5. A permutation is applied to the result

### Brute Force Attacks

Testing all the possible $2^k$ keys (where $k$ is the size of the key $K$). $k = 56$ is fairly small, requiring only $2^{k}/2 = 2^55$ trials on average - this was criticised from the start.

The key can be identified by using a small number of ciphertext blocks and looking for low entropy in the decrypted plaintext.

### Double Encryption

Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be two block cipher keys.

Encryption: $C = E(E(P, K_1), K_2)$.

If both keys have length $k$, exhaustive attacks require $2^{2k - 1}$ trials on average.

#### Meet-in-the-Middle Attack

Let $(P, C)$ is a single plaintext-ciphertext pair:

1. For each key $K$, store $C' = E(P, K)$ in memory
2. For any key $K'$, check if $D(C, K') = C'$ (i.e. matches any ciphertext stored in memory)
    - If this is found, $K$ is $K_1$ and $K'$ is $K_2$
    - Check if key values work for other $(P, C)$ pairs

Requirements:

- Storing one plaintext block for every key: $2^56$ 64-bit blocks
- An encryption operation for every key
- A decryption operation for every key

Expensive but still much cheaper than brute-forcing $2^111$ keys.

### Triple Encryption

Requires three keys: $C = E(D(E(P, K_1), K_2), K_3)$. (symmetric so decryption/encryption doesn't matter? TODO)

This increases the computational requirements enough to make it secure against MITM attacks.

NIST SP 800-131A (2015) approves two-key triple DES, where $K_1 = K_3$, only for legacy use. three-key triple DES is approved.

OpenSSL removed triple DES in 2016. Office 365 stopped using triple DES in 2018.

## AES

Designed in an open competition after controversy over DES. Winning submission is 'Rijndael'.

- 128-bit data block
- 128-, 192- or 256-bit master key
- Byte-based design
- Substitution-permutation network
  - Initial round key addition
  - 10, 12, or 14 rounds (depending on key size)
  - Final round

### Algorithm

#### State Matrix

16-byte data block size arranged in a $4 \times 4$ matrix.

Mixture of finite field operations in $GF(2^8)$ and bit string operations.

#### Round Transformation

Each round has four basic operations:

1. ByteSub (non-linear substitution): substitute each byte wth a different value using a substitution table
2. ShiftRow (permutation): rotate first row right by zero bytes, second row right by one byte... (bytes wrap to left)
3. MixColumn (diffusion): each column is replaced with result of it being multiplied by a matrix
4. AddRoundKey: XORs array with round key

Substitution-permutation network with block length of $n = 128$ and sub-block length of $l - 8$.

S-box uses look-up table.

##### Key Schedule

Master key is 128/192/256 bits.

Each of the 10/12/14 rounds uses a 128-bit subkey. There is one subkey per round plus one initial subkey, all derived from the master key.

### Security

Some weaknesses but no significant break; most serious real attacks can reduce effective key size by around two bits.

Vulnerable to related-key attack: attacker obtains a ciphertext encrypted with a key related to an actual key in a specified way.

### Comparisons with DES

- Data block size: 64 vs 128 bits
- Key size: 56 vs 128/192/256 bits
- Design:
  - Both iterated ciphers
  - DES uses Feistel; AES uses SPN
  - AES substantially faster in both hardware and software

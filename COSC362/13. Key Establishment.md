# 13. Key Establishment

Distribution of cryptographic keys to protect subsequent sessions. In TLS, public keys allow clients/servers to share a new communication key.

Kerberos: key establishment without public keys.

## Key Management

Key management has four phases:

- Key generation: keys should be generated such that they are all equally likely to occur
- Key distribution: keys should be distributed in a secure fashion
- Key protection: keys should be accessible only to authorized parties
- Key destruction: once a key has performed its function, it should be destroyed such that it (TODO the encrypted data?) has value to an attacker

## Hierarchy

Keys often organized into a hierarchy. In a two-level hierarchy, there are long- and short-term keys:

- Long-term/static keys are used to protect the distribution of session keys. They may last anywhere from a few hours to a few years, depending on the application
- Short-term/session/ephemeral keys are used to protect communications in a session. They may last anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the application

## Key Establishment

Symmetric keys with ciphers (e.g. AES, MAC) are used in practice for session keys as as they are more efficient than public key algorithms.

Long-term keys can be symmetric or asymmetric.

<!--
Common approaches to establishing secret session keys using long-term keys: 

- Key pre-distribution of long-term keys by a trusted authority TODO 48min
- Using an online server with symmetric long-term keys
- Usin assymetric long-term keys

# 16. Introduction to the Web and HTTP

## Network Applications

Network applications are programs that run on different end-systems and communicate with each other over the network (e.g. web browser and server).

Application *protocols* are a small part of a network application, and different network applications may share the same application protocol.

Services applications need:

- Reliable data transfer (except some loss-tolerant applications like multimedia streaming)
- Bandwidth
  - Some are rate-sensitive such as audio calls
  - Some are elastic e.g. email, FTP
- Latency
  - Some interactive real-time apps such as audio calls, VR, multi-player games etc. have tight end-to-end delay constraints

TCP provides a reliable transport service, flow control and congestion control, but no guarantees for latency or transmission rate.

UDP provides none of these guarantees.

### Application Structure

Client-server:

- Server:
  - Always-on
  - Permanent IP address
  - May use server farms for scaling
- Clients:
- Communicate with the server
- May be intermittently connected
- May have dynamic IP addresses
- Do not communicate directly with each other

Peer-to-peer:

- No always-on server
- Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- Peers intermittently connected and can change IP addresses
- Highly scalable
- Difficult to manage

Hybrid. Napster is an example:

- File transfer uses peer-to-peer
- File search is centralized; peers register content at central server and query it to locate content

## The Web

- On-demand service, compared to TV or radio which were scheduled

## HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

A web page consists of a base HTML-file and several referenced **objects**:

- Can be a HTML file (`iframe`), image (`img`), audio file etc.
- Each object is addressable by a URL

HTTP uses the client-server model:

- The browser requests, receives and displays web objects
- The server sends objects in response to requests

Uses TCP:

- Client initiates a TCP connection to the server in **port 80**
- Server accepts the TCP connection
- HTTP messages exchanged between the browser and server
- TCP connection closed

HTTP is stateless: the server *can* work without maintaining any information about past client requests.

### HTTP Connections

**Non-persistent HTTP**: At most *one object* is sent over a TCP connection. Used by HTTP/1.0

**Persistent HTTP**: multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection; used by HTTP/1.1 by default

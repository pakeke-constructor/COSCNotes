# 13. Transport Layer Protocol - Reliable Data Transfer

## TCP Segments

TCP will divide each message into segments - the sequence number for each segment is the **index of the first data byte** in the segment. In practice, a random sequence number is used for the initial segment's sequence number.

The receiver's ACK message contains the index of the **largest byte received**: the segment's sequence number plus the number of data bytes.

TCP uses a **single retransmission timer**.

Simplified TCP sender (without refinements below):

```python
next_sequence_number = initial_sequence_number
send_base = initial_sequence_number
while True:
  if # data received from upper layer:
    segment = create_tcp_segment(next_sequence_number)
    if timer is None: # no unacknowledged segments in the window
      timer = start_timer()
    send_packet(segment)
    next_sequence_number += len(segment.data)

  elif # timer expired:
    # re-send the segment with the oldest sequence number 
    segment = unacknowledged_packets_in_window()[0]
    send_packet(segment)
    timer = start_timer()

  elif # ack received:
    ack = get_sequence_number()
    if ack > send_base:
      send_base = ack # cumulative ACK
      if len(unacknowledged_packets_in_window()) != 0:
        timer = start_timer()
```

Some refinements:

- When the timer expires, **double the timeout** interval: `timeout_interval *= 2`
  - The expiration may be an indication of congestion
  - Typical initial value is one second
- When the timer is restarted, reset the timeout interval to its initial value
- Timer restarts occur when an ACK arrives or data is received from the upper layer AND there are currently no unacknowledged segments
- **Fast retransmit**: If the sender receives three ACKs with the same segment number, retransmit it before the timeout
- ACKs coming back may also be a signal that the network is not too congested

 Events on the receiver side:

- In order segment with expected sequence number arrives:
  - Wait 500 ms; if no segment comes within this time, send an ACK
- Above, but there is already another segment with pending ACK:
  - Immediately send an ACK, acknowledging the arrival of both packets
- Out-of-order segment with higher-than-expected sequence number:
  - Immediately send a duplicate ACK with the sequence number of the next expected byte
- Arrival of segment that partially/completely fills a gap:
  - If the segment fills in the start of the gap, immediately send an ACK

TCP is a mixture of the go-back-*N* and selective repeat strategies:

- It uses cumulative ACK, similar to GBN
- Out-of-order segments are often buffered, similar to SR
- When there is a timeout, the sender retransmits only the smallest unacknowledged packet, unlike GBN

### Setting the Timeout Value

The timeout value should be longer than the round-trip time, so the first step is to find this value.

The `SampleRTT` will be the time from segment transmission to ACK, with the condition that **retransmissions should not be used** - the ACK for the first transmission could arrive after the sender retransmits, giving a wrong value.

The RTT varies over time, so several samples are required. This is done using **exponential weighted moving average**, which puts more weights on more recent samples:

$EstimatedRTT = (1 - \alpha) \cdot EstimatedRTT + \alpha \cdot SampleRTT$, where $\alpha$ is typically a value such as $0.125$.

An estimate of the variability is also required:

$DevRTT = (1 - \beta) \cdot DevRTT + \beta \cdot |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|$, where $\beta$ is typically a value such as $0.25$.

With these two values, the timeout interval can be calculated:

$TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 \cdot DevRTT$

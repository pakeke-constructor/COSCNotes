# 18. GPU-Based Programming Concepts

## Shared Memory Programming

Works best when the access latency is small - hence, with small memory spaces.

A common workload which works on a small amount of memory and requires many processes is in graphics processing.

CPU:

```
--------------------
| Control | ALU  ALU |
|         | ALU  ALU |
----------------------
| Cache              |
---------------------
----------------------
| DRAM               |
---------------------
```

NB: cache and DRAM more continuous now.

- The closer the memory is to the core, the lower the latency.
- ALUs now very large and complex as it must support a large number of operations

GPU:
```
---------------------
| Ctrl |    ALU     |
| Cach |            |
--------------------
| Ctrl |    ALU     |
| Cach |            |
--------------------
| Ctrl |    ALU     |
| Cach |            |
--------------------
| Ctrl |    ALU     |
| Cach |            |
--------------------
```

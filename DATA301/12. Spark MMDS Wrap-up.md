# 12. Spark MMDS Wrap-up

## Additional Spark TODO

- GraphX: represents graph as RDD; PageRank built in
- MLib: common ML algorithms inc. clustering (for high-dimensional spaces that are niggly to represent as graphs)
- Streaming: for live-streamed data (e.g. online ad matching)
- SQL: wrapper around RDDs

TODO

### 

What if everything is connected?

Tangentially related as they are in the same domain. May not be direct connections or connections may be connected on the fly.

Can always find cost between any two points; direct connection exists for every single point.

Given a set of points with a notion of *distance* between points, group the points into some number of *clusters*.

This is a problem, especially for higher-dimensional spaces. e.g. for movie recommendations, each movie is a dimension.

TODO


### Point Assignment: $k$-means

Pick the number of clusters $k$ and initialize clusters by picking one point for each cluster (hopefully each far away from the other points).

For each point, place it in the cluster whose centroid ('center of mass' of a cluster) is the nearest. Need to compute $nk$ distances per iteration.

After all points are assigned, update the locations of the centroids (a computed value so it is not necessarily an existing point).

Repeat until it converges (i.e. until centroids do not update).

<!-- Then, change $k$ until you find the best number of clusters. -->


### Online Algorithms

Offline/classical algorithms: algorithms have access to the entire input

Online algorithms: algorithm given access to the input one piece at a time, and must make irrevocable decisions along the way.

Given a set of elements being selected and elements doing the selecting (and are willing to select some subset), determine which element should be given.

TODO

How good is the algorithm?

#### Competitive Ratio

Algorithm's *worst* performance over all possible inputs: ratio of algorithm's solution to optimal solution (if future is known).

If average performance is taken, an adversary could ensure the worst case is always reached.

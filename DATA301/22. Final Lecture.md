# 22. Final Lecture

Big data viewed from two directions:

- Us; the 3 Perspectives: Architecture/Algorithm/Programming (exam structured this way, multi-choice section must be answered sequentially)
- Clients, the 5 V Challenges: Variety/Velocity/Volume/Veracity/Value

Exam topics:

- Programming

Knowledge: awareness

Analysis: pros and cons, comparisons to others, is this an appropriate solution to this scenario?

Application (skill):

- Apply an algorithm
- Implement an algorithm

CodeBox environment.

Have access to course notes, sample solutions to labs, locked-down version of Colab. Bring phone for 2FA.

10-15 multiple choice questions

2 hours

Code questions on Spark

Analysis type questions on MPI

Multichoice on GPU programming, message passing, threads, locks and atomics, work queues, schedulers

Algorithms:

- Union, intersection, difference
  - Distance/similarity: Jaccard/Cosine
- Matrix-Vector multiplication
- Hashing
- Graphs

Communication cost: Amdahl's Law, Gustafson's Law

Weak vs strong scalability

SAMPLE QUESTION

Caching (spatial/temporal locality)
Time sensitive operation: logging, DDOS detection

sc.readFile().flatMap(lambda line: [strip(el) for el in line.split(" ") if len(strip(el)) and [next(char) for char in el if not isalpha(el)] is None]).

 next((True for char in word if not char.isalpha()), None) is not None

## Matrix Multiplication

Product of matrix $M$ with vector $v$:

$$
(Mv)_i = \sum_j{m_{ij}v_j}
$$

Matrices and vectors are stored in **sparse form**:

- Matrices: $(i, j, m_{ij})$ for non-zero entries
- Vectors: $(i, v_i)$ for elements of the vector

### Vector Fits in Memory

If the vector fits in memory, but the matrix does not:

- Each map task gets the entire vector and some values from the matrix
  - For each value $(i, j, m_{ij})$, it outputs $(i, m_{ij}\cdot v_j)$
- Each reduce task is given one or more rows $i$, and calculates the sum

### Vector Doesn't Fit in Memory

- Matrix and vector both split into stripes (matrix split into columns, vector into rows)
- For each partial row of the matrix, the partial sum of products is calculated
- For each row, the reduce task can calculate the total sum from multiple partial sums

### Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

Repeat matrix-vector multiplication across each column in the second matrix.

## Cloud Computing

A platform: a collection of integrated and networked hardware, software and internet infrastructure.

Tiers:

- Service Value Nets: user-facing value e.g. SalesForce CRM
- Platform as a Service: e.g. Google App Platform, Heroku
- Infrastructure as a Service: renting storage, compute resources e.g. Linode, AWS

### Virtualization

Multiple VMs running on a single physical machines: sandboxes user code to ensure it is completely isolated from any other user code.

Cloud advantages:

- Much faster and greater scaling possible
- Ease of use: high-level services available
- No dedicated personnel required to manage hardware

Disadvantages:

- Local processing may be faster than transferring data over the network
- No control when it fails
- Privacy concerns

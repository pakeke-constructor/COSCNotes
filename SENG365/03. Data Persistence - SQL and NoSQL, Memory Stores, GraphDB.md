# 03. Data Persistence - SQL and NoSQL, Memory Stores, GraphDB

## POJO and JSON

POJO: Plain Old JS Object. Essentially a struct.

JSON is very similar to a POJO:

- Data-interchange format
- No versioning
- For serializing data

## SQL

ACID:

- Atomic: transaction is either fully completed or fully fails
- Consistency: DB is in a valid state before and after the transaction
- Isolated: transactions should be isolated from other in-progress transactions
- Durable: once transactions are committed, they should not be lost

CAP Theorem: if you have a distributed system, pick two:

- Consistency: every read receives the most recent data
- Availability: every read receives a response
- Partition tolerance: system can function even if network goes down

BASE: give up consistency and get:

- Basic availability (through replication)
- Soft state: the state can change over time - this happens due to:
- Eventual consistency: the data will be consistent eventually (if the data is not changed frequently)

A BASE transaction may act like multiple transactions in ACID.

## Key-Value Stores

Don't bother defining schemas, just plonk a key and value together.

- Upsides: fast, simple, flexible, scalable
- Downsides:
  - No validation at all
  - Consistency checking offloaded from DB to application
  - No relationships
  - No aggregate operations
  - No search operations (other than via key)

In-memory data store (e.g. redis):

- Stores whole DB in memory
- Useful for caching common responses

## Document Database

- Bunch of JSON/XML files indexed and stored in DB
- Lots of duplicated data
- Risk of inconsistent document structures

## Graph Database

- Node: entity
- Edges: relationship between entities
  - Can be uni/bi-directional
  - Weights map to relationship properties
- Properties: describe attributes of a node/edge
- Hypergraph: one edge joining multiple nodes

Semantic web:

- Subject-predicate-object (nodes are nouns, edges are verbs, attributes are adjectives/adverbs respectively)
- Nodes are URIs/values
- Represented as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple stores
- Linked data on the web

Labelled property graph:

- Nodes and edges have an internal structure
- More efficient to store than RDF

Graph databases give measures of centrality such as:

- Degree: indegree/outdegree
- Closeness: average length of all shortest paths
- Betweenness: number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest paths
- Eigenvector: influence of a node in the network

Query languages available for graph databases (e.g. Cyper for neo4j).

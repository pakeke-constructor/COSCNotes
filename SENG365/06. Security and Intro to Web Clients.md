# 06. Security and Intro to Web Clients

## Security

### [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

1. Injection
2. Broken authentication (sessions handled incorrectly, assuming another user's identity)
3. Unprotected sensitive data (data stored in plain text at rest etc.)
4. XML external entities being evaluated
5. Broken access control (roles - permissions for authorized users)
6. Security misconfiguration (insecure defaults, verbose error messages)
7. XSS
8. Insecure de-serialization (replay/injection attacks, privilege escalation, remote code execution)
9. Vulnerable components (libraries not updated etc.)
10. Insufficient logging/monitoring

### Injection

Any time an application uses **an interpreter of any type** there is a danger of introducing an injection vulnerability.

When a web app passes information from an HTTP request as part of an external request, the input must be sanitized. **All injection attacks are input-validation errors**.

**All external input is a threat**; text inputs, check boxes, cookies, HTTP headers etc.. Never rely on client-side validation.

Command injection: when unsanitized user input is part of a shell command.

### Authentication

Authentication: establish claimed identity

Authorization: establish permission to act

Authentication always comes before authorization.

Three factors:

- Something you *know*
- Something you *have*
- Something you *are*

### HTTP

HTTP is a stateless protocol; credentials must be sent with every request. Hence, SSL should be used for everything requiring authentication.

That is, **every single request needs to be authenticated and then authorized** before completing any request.

Session management: some session ID cookie needed as HTTP stateless; often exposed on the network

Side-doors: change password, forgot my password, secret questions etc.

### Mitigation

Architecture:

- Authentication should be simple, **centralized** and **standardized**
- Use the standard session ID used by your container
- Be sure SSL projects the credentials *and* session ID at all times

Implementation:

- Check SSL certificate
- Examine all auth-related functions
- Verify that log off actually destroys the session

### XSS

Attacker gets malicious script into a web page that stores data on the server; this script now has access to everything on the page, including DOM and cookies.

e.g. intercepting login requests and redirecting to an attacker-controlled website.

DOM-based XSS Injection:

- Untrusted data should only ever be displayed as text
- JS encode and delimit untrusted data with quoted strings; just looking for quotes isn't enough (backticks, nice browsers correcting 'sloppy' markup, escape sequences etc.)

## Web Clients

JS has no concept of input or output; instead, the host environment provides mechanisms for communicating with the outside world.

JS in the browser must work in a variety of environments: different machine speeds, browsers, versions, network connections, disabled features (e.g. cookies) etc.

NodeJS and browser JS have different APIs for importing libraries.

# 10. Web Storage and PWAs

## Web Storage and IndexedDB

### Local and Session Storage

Cookies; ~4 KB max, sent to server on every request. HTML5 storage supports ~5 MB max.

Storage is key-value string pairs accessible to JS on a specific origin (protocol + domain + port).

Two types of storage:

- Local storage: permanent data for site; key-value string pairs
- Session storage: cleared after end of session

### IndexedDB

A indexed NoSQL DB:

- Multiple object stores
- Primary keys
- Indexes
- Asynchronous CRUD requests

### CacheStorage

Stores pairs of request and response objects; for caching web resources.

Can be few hundred MBs.

```js
const cache = await cache.open("my-cache");

// Adding
cache.add("some-path");
cache.add(new Request("some-path"));
cache.addAll(["path1", "path2"]);

// Putting any content in
cache.put("some-path", new Response(responseStr));


// Retrieving
const response = await cache.match(request);
```

## Progressive Web Apps

Appear to be 'installed' like native apps: begin life in a browser tab and can be 'installed'.

A PWA must:

- Originate from a **secure origin**
- Load while offline
- Reference a **Web App Manifest**: JSON file with properties such as name, start URL and icon
  - Linked in the HTML page: `<link rel="manifest" href="./manifest.json">`

It should:

- Act like an app; mobile friendly and fluid animations
- Load quickly: < 5s before service worker installed, < 2s after installation

### Service Workers

Proxy 'servers' between the web app and network. Runs headless in its own thread, and must use HTTPS.

Service workers are used for notifications and background sync.

Service workers must be started by the web page:

```js
if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) window.addEventListener("load", () => {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("./worker.js").then(registration => {
    console.log(`Scope: ${registration.scope}`);
  }).catch(err => console.error(err));
});
```

After installation, it can be in a few states:

- Activated
- Idle
- Terminated
- Fetch/message

Using service workers and CacheStorage:

```js

```

### WebAssembly

Binary code that is pre-compiled to wasm bytecode - supported languages include C, C++ and Rust.

Ahead-of-time or just-in-time (interpreted) compilation of wasm.

<title>Week 12 Concluding Remarks</title></head>
<body><h1>Week 12: Concluding Remarks</h1>
<p>Final Exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most programming questions have feedback; some have hidden test cases</li>
<li>Covers content from the entire course: slightly less emphasis on content from lab test such that lab test (20%) + exam give even grade coverage</li>
<li>2019 exam will be available: note that some exam questions have been used in this year&#39;s quizzes</li>
<li>Past exams had some different content (e.g. Clojure, computer vision)</li>
<li>Wrong selections in multi-choice questions take away from the mark for the grade (higher weight than correct selections)</li>
<li>No access to lecture notes; there will be info on how to run prolog etc.</li>

</ul>
<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning (graph algorithms, path finding)</li>
<li>Problem solving (constraint satisfaction problems)</li>
<li>Logic</li>
<li>Reasoning (classical logic, probabilistic reasoning)</li>
<li>Working with uncertainty (probabilistic methods)</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Competing with adversaries (games)</li>

</ul>
<p>A recurring pattern across these topics is that the problems they solve can be reduced to search problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The industrial revolution fundamentally changed how physical goods were produced, redistributing wealth and job opportunities. Will AI lead to a fundamental shift in how decisions are made?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fairness: AI in justice systems, recruiting etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Singularity: recursive self-improvement leading to runaway systems</p>
<ul>
<li>AI probably won&#39;t destroy humanity; we&#39;re doing a good enough job already</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>Related topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probability theory, multivariate statistics, Bayesian inference</li>
<li>Linear algebra, optimization, functional analysis</li>

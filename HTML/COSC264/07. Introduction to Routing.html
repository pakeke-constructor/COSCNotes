<h2>Network Layer Overview</h2>
<p>Names of data units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application: message</li>
<li>Transport: segment</li>
<li>Network: datagram</li>
<li>Link: frame</li>

</ul>
<p>Responsibilities of layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network layer: responsible for finding a route from A to B</li>
<li>Transport layer: responsible for transporting data from A to be <strong>reliably</strong> or <strong>easily</strong></li>
<li>Application layer: responsible for sharing data</li>

</ul>
<p>Layering: each layer takes data from above, adds header information then passes the new data unit to the layer before.</p>
<p>Possible services of a general network layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guaranteed delivery (with/without bounded delay)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-order delivery</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guaranteed minimal bandwidth</p>
</li>
<li><p>Guaranteed maximum jitter</p>
<ul>
<li>Jitter: gap between two consecutive messages</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>The internet network layer, IPv4 guarantees none of these.</p>
<h2>Routing Overview</h2>
<p>Routing is a <strong>network-wide</strong> process that determines the end-to-end paths packets take from source to destination.</p>
<p>The network needs to work out the path from the sending to receiving <strong>router</strong> <strong>automatically</strong> in an <strong>dynamic environment</strong>.</p>
<p>A router uses its routing table to forward a packet to some output link.</p>
<p>The router&#39;s <strong>switch fabric</strong> - the physical architecture of the router, varies. Some implementations put the network interfaces/line cards close to the CPU to decrease processing times. The cross bar architecture is used to more quickly forward packets to outgoing interfaces.</p>
<h3>Hierarchical Overview</h3>
<p>There are <strong>inter-AS</strong> and <strong>intra-AS</strong> routing algorithms, where AS stands for an <strong>autonomous system</strong>.</p>
<p>Each ISP is an AS, and some corporations and universities are also ASs.</p>
<p>Each AS is a set of routers and networks <strong>managed by a single organization</strong>. The routers exchange information via a common routing protocol - the intra routing protocol.</p>
<p>The only inter-AS routing protocol is that is used is BGP. The RIP and OSFP protocols are the two main intra-AS routing protocols. All three are load-insensitive.</p>
<p>There are three types of AS:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stub</strong> AS</p>
<ul>
<li>Has only one connection to another AS</li>
<li>Like a leaf node</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-homed</strong> AS</p>
<ul>
<li>Has more than one connection to other ASs, but <strong>does not allow traffic to path through</strong></li>
<li>e.g. university network will not be doing forwarding</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Transit</strong> AS</p>
<ul>
<li>Has more than one AS and allows traffic to path through</li>
<li>Run by ISPs</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Forwarding vs Routing</h3>
<p>Forwarding and routing are two independent processes.</p>
<p>Routing <strong>determines the path to take</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is not done packet-per-packet</li>
<li>Is non-real time: up to two minutes of latency</li>
<li>Requires communication between routers to <strong>jointly create forwarding tables</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>Forwarding transfers packets hop-by-hop:</p>
<ul>
<li>It determines which outgoing link to use on a packet-by-packet basis</li>
<li>Is done in real time, possibly in hardware</li>

</ul>
<p>The forwarding table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maps a destination address to an interface</li>
<li>Results from either the execution of the routing protocol or is static and preconfigured</li>
<li>Is consulted for every packet</li>
<li>Changes on relatively large timescales (e.g. topology or load changes)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Classification of Routing Algorithms</h3>
<p>Routing algorithms solves a routing problem with ideal assumptions. Routing <strong>protocols</strong> embeds a routing algorithm in a real network environment; it operates in a distributed environment and can work around failure cases.</p>
<h4>Classifications</h4>
<h5>Static/dynamic</h5>
<p>Static algorithms change very slowly over time, mostly due to human intervention.</p>
<p>Dynamic algorithms re-compute routes in response to topology or traffic changes. The computation may occur periodically or in response to changes.</p>
<h5>Global/Decentralized</h5>
<p>Global algorithms assumes each node has global knowledge/state information on the network.</p>
<p>Decentralized algorithms assume no node has complete state information about the network and exchange information with their neighbours.</p>
<h5>Load-sensitive/-insensitive</h5>
<p>Load-sensitive algorithms assume link costs vary dynamically depending on the level of congestion in the link.</p>
<p>Internet routing protocols such as RIP, OSPF and BGP are load-insensitive and assign a static cost to each link.</p>

# 20. Design by Contractâ„¢

Preconditions: before calling service, client must check everything is ready.

Postconditions: the service promises some invariant; something the service promises will always be true.

e.g.

```java
public class Stack<T> {
  /**
   * Precondition: stack not empty
   * Postcondition: stack unchanged, last pushed object returned
   */
  public <T> peek();

  /**
   * Precondition: stack not empty
   * Postcondition: stack size decreased by 1, last pushed object returned
   */
  public <T> pop();

  /**
   * Precondition: stack not full
   * Postcondition: stack sized increased by 1, `peek() == o`
   */
  public void push(T o);
}
```

The contract for a class is the union of the contracts of its methods.

### Testing

Contracts inform testing; assertions allow us to check:

- If preconditions hold
- If invariants are invariant
- If postconditions hold
- If there are any side effects
- If there are any exceptions

```
        Preconditions/
         Input Values
              |
              v
    |--------------------|
    | Software Component |
    |                    |
    | Errors/Exceptions  | --> Side Effects
    |                    |
    |--------------------|
              |
              v
       Postconditions/
        Output Values
```

### Inheritance

Subclasses may have different pre/post conditions. Would require checking if the object is an instance of the subclass to determine if preconditions are met - this breaks the LSP.

Contracts are inherited:

- Preconditions can be loosened
- Postconditions and invariants can be tightened

That is, **require no more, promise no less**.

### Guidelines

- No preconditions on queries; it should be safe to ask a question
- No fine print
  - **Don't require something that the client can't determined**; preconditions should be supported by public methods
  - But the client doesn't need to verify postconditions
- Use real code where possible
- But use English where you can't show all the semantics
- No hidden clauses; the preconditions should be sufficient and complete
- No redundant checking; **the server shouldn't verify preconditions are met**

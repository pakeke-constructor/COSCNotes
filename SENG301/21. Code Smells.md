# 20. Code Smells

## Process

1. Sniff
2. Prioritise and evaluate
3. Refactor:
    - Split
    - Join
    - Move
    - Extract
    - Rename
    - etc.

## How large is large?

- Smells are inherently subjective
- Easier to detect in code we know
- Can be informed by measurements - *software metrics*
  - Define quantities that represent code qualities we want to understand
  - Gather data
  - Analyze results, statistics
    - Percentiles, min/max, outliers etc.

## Morphology

Fan-out:

- How many other methods/functions does the method call
- Is it too 'big'?

Fan-in:

- How many others call the method
- How reusable is it?

### Method Length

Metrics:

- Lines of code
  - Number of statements
  - Comments included?
  - Declarations included?
  - Whitespace included?
- Amount of logic: cyclomatic complexity
  - Number of branches
- Amount of nesting

Long methods a problem because:

- Method may be doing too many things
- Single responsibility principle
- Cohesion

How long is too long? Use:

- Metrics
- Counting rules
- Distribution analysis
  - e.g. statement count vs cyclomatic complexity; find and refactor outliers

## Object-Oriented Metrics

Chidamber & Kemerer suite commonly used:

- Weighted Methods per Class (WMC): class size
  - How many methods are there? Takes into account constructors, overloads etc.
- Number of Children (NOC): structure
- Depth in Inheritance Tree (DIT): structure
- Coupling Between Objects (CBO): dependencies
- Response For Class (RFC): message passing
- Lack of Cohesion Of Methods (LCOM): property/method interactions

Large class smell:

- Knows too much, does too much; violating single responsibility principle
  - God class

Break into smaller cohesive classes: extract class, extract interface

Long parameter lists:

- Interface segregation
- If the parameter list is long, what does it tell us about the method?
  - Single responsibility
  - God method?
- How complex is it?

Solutions:

- Introduce a parameter object
- Preserve the whole object
- Replace the parameter with a method call
  - Caller should get the data itself rather than letting the method do it for it

Duplicated code:

- 'Once and only once'
- Same problem may be solved in multiple ways (different programmers
- Single place of truth

Extract it into a method

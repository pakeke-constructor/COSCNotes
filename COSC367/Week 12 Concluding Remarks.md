# Week 12: Concluding Remarks

Final Exam:

- Most programming questions have feedback; some have hidden test cases
- Covers content from the entire course: slightly less emphasis on content from lab test such that lab test (20%) + exam give even grade coverage
- 2019 exam will be available: note that some exam questions have been used in this year's quizzes
- Past exams had some different content (e.g. Clojure, computer vision)
- Wrong selections in multi-choice questions take away from the mark for the grade (higher weight than correct selections)
- No access to lecture notes; there will be info on how to run prolog etc.

Topics covered:

- Planning (graph algorithms, path finding)
- Problem solving (constraint satisfaction problems)
- Logic
- Reasoning (classical logic, probabilistic reasoning)
- Working with uncertainty (probabilistic methods)
- Learning
- Competing with adversaries (games)

A recurring pattern across these topics is that the problems they solve can be reduced to search problems.

- The industrial revolution fundamentally changed how physical goods were produced, redistributing wealth and job opportunities. Will AI lead to a fundamental shift in how decisions are made?
- Fairness: AI in justice systems, recruiting etc.
- Singularity: recursive self-improvement leading to runaway systems
  - AI probably won't destroy humanity; we're doing a good enough job already

Related topics:

- Probability theory, multivariate statistics, Bayesian inference
- Linear algebra, optimization, functional analysis

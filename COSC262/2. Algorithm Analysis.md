# 2. Algorithm Analysis

Once an algorithm is shown to be correct, consider the:

- **Efficiency** in time and space
  - Big O
  - Big Omega
  - Big Theta
- **Complexity** in terms of the size of the input
- **Worse**, **average**, and **best** case
  - Focus on the worst case
- Asymptotic analysis: $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}{time(n)}$

## Complexity

The time taken will depend on the instance of the problem being solved.

## RAM Model of Computation

Abstract random access machine

- Accessing any byte in memory takes constant time
- Basic operations (arithmetic, comparison, assignment) take one unit of time
- Time inside loops proportional to the number of iterations
- Subroutine time is the time to execute its body

## Formal Definitions

### Big O (upper bound)

$$
O(G) = {f|\exists c>0: \exists x_0: \forall x\ge x_0: 0 \le f(x) \le c \cdot g(x)}
$$

That is, $f(x)$ is part of the set $O(g)$ if there exists a positive multiplier $c$ such that for every value of $x$ greater than $x_0$, $f(x) \le c\cdot g(x)$.

### Big Omega (lower bound)

$$
\Omega(G) = {f \exists c>0: \exists x_0: \forall x\ge x_0: 0 \le c\ cdot g(x) \le f(x)}
$$

That is, $f(x)$ is part of the set $\Omega(g)$ if there exists a positive multiplier $c$ such that for every value of $x$ greater than $x_0$, $c\cdot g(x) \le f(x)$.

### Big Theta (tight bound)

$$
\Omega(g) = O(g) \cap \Omega(g)
$$

That is, $f(x)$ is part of the set $\Theta(g)$ if it is such that for every value of $x$ above $x_0$, there exists $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that that $c_1 \cdot g(x) \le f(x) \le c_2 \cdot g(x)$.

The worst case and best case are functions: the *algorithm* is not, so we cannot define the algorithm by Big O/Omega/Theta notation.

The best case of an algorithm will be $\Theta(g)$; the algorithm is not $\Theta(g)$. Ideally, an algorithm would be separately categorized by its best and worst case. In practice, we often categorize the algorithm by its worst case.

Common functions, sorted by complexity descending:

|  Functions  |
| ----------- |
|     $x!$    |
|    $a^x$    |
|    $x^a$    |
| $x \log(x)$ |
|     $x$     |
|  $\log(x)$  |
|     $a$     |
